Smart Inverter Technical Requirements

When requirements for “Smart Inverter” are specified in these Requirements, those requirements can also
be met by a “DER Interconnection System” as defined in these Requirements.

These Smart Inverter Technical Requirements shall apply for interconnection of inverter-based
technologies. These inverter requirements are intended to be consistent with UL 1741 — Supplement SB
using as the source requirement document ANSI/IEEE 1547-2018 and IEEE 1547.1-2020 Standard for
Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems where possible. In the event of a
conflict between these Requirements and UL 1741 — Supplement SB and/or IEEE 1547-2018 or IEEE
1547.1-2020, these Requirements shall take precedence.

The Smart Inverter default settings and default activation states shall be modified upon mutual agreement
between Applicant or Producer and LADWP. The Smart Inverter default settings and default activation
states shall also be modified at the sole discretion of LADWP for safety or reliability reasons as
determined solely by LADWP.

Process for changing default settings for new Interconnection Requests:

e LADWP, in the study process for new Generating Facilities, may determine and provide the optimum
Smart Inverter Settings for the reactive power settings, including changes to the reactive power
default settings (Example: Deactivate Volt/Var and activate Fixed Power Factor at given power
factor).

e LADWP, in the study process for new Generating Facilities, may determine and provide the optimum
Smart Inverter Settings for the Ramp Rate settings depending on the Generating Facility technology
(such as solar, storage).

e LADWP, in the study process for new Generating Facilities, may determine the optimum Smart
Inverter Settings for the volt/watt settings, including changes to the default settings (Example: Change
the volt/watt set points). The Applicant may select to agree on the new settings or select to perform
upgrades to operate using the existing default volt/watt settings.

e Default settings for voltage ride-through, frequency ride-through requirements, and Frequency/Watt
should not be modified on an individual project basis unless the Interconnection Studies have
determined that the default settings may not meet grid reliability requirements.

Process for changing default settings for Generating Facilities with an executed Interconnection
Agreement:

e When grid changes or Generating Facility changes require that the Smart Inverter operating
parameters be reevaluated, LADWP or Producer may request changes to the Smart Inverter
operating parameters. The request must include the reason for and timing of the proposed changes.
The requested changes must be within the Smart Inverter function adjustability limits, must be within
the limits specified in these Requirements, and must be mutually agreed upon. LADWP may also
notify Producer of required changes to the Smart Inverter operating parameters for safety or reliability
reasons as determined solely by LADWP. In the event of this LADWP notification, Producer shall
make the required changes and provide written notification to LADWP within a reasonable time
determined by LADWP.

2. Prevention of Interference

Producer shall not operate Smart Inverters that superimpose a voltage or current upon LADWP’s
Distribution or Transmission System that interferes with LADWP operations, service to LADWP
Customers, or communication facilities. If such interference occurs, Producer must diligently pursue
and take corrective action at its own expense after being given notice and reasonable time to do so by
LADWP. If Producer does not take corrective action in a timely manner, or continues to operate the
facilities causing interference without restriction or limit, LADWP may, without liability, disconnect
Producer's facilities from LADWP’s Distribution System, in accordance with Section K of the Design
Guide for Customer-Owned Parallel Generating System of the Electric Service Requirements. To
eliminate undesirable interference caused by its operation, each Smart Inverter shall meet the following
criteria:

Except as otherwise stated, the RPA for all performance requirements shall be met at the PCC.

When the Generating Facility is less than 500kVA, the RPA may be the Point of Generating Resource

If approved by LADWP, the Smart Inverter may actively regulate the voltage at the PCC while in
parallel with LADWP’s Distribution System. The Smart Inverter shall not cause the service voltage
at other customers to go outside the requirements of ANSI C84.1-1995, Range A (IEEE 1547-2018,
5.1).

b) Voltage Trip and Ride Through Setting

The voltage ranges in Table 1a and 1b define protective trip limits for the Protective Function and
are not intended to define or imply a voltage regulation Function. Generating Facilities shall cease
to energize LADWP’s Distribution System within the prescribed trip time whenever the voltage at
the PCC deviates from the allowable voltage operating range. The Protective Function shall detect
and respond to voltage on all phases to which the Generating Facility is connected.

i) Smart Inverters

Smart Inverters shall be capable of operating within the voltage range normally experienced on
LADWP’s Distribution System from plus to minus 5% of the nominal voltage (e.g. 114 volts to 126

may be selected in a manner that minimizes nuisance tripping in accordance with Table 1a to
compensate for voltage drop between the generator terminals and the PCC. Voltage may be
detected at either the PCC or the Point of Interconnection. However, the voltage range at the PCC,
with the generator on-line, shall stay within +/-5% of nominal.
