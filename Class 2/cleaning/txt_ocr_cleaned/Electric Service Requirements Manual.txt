B. PLANNING ELECTRIC SERVICES

1.

INITIAL CONTACT

When considering the design of electrical facilities for a residential, commercial, or industrial premises,
customers should contact the Department service planning office in the area where service is to be
supplied as soon as possible so that:

a. The Department's service planning staff can work with the customer to establish a serving voltage and
an acceptable meter and service location.

b. Customers may avoid unnecessary expenses and delays in service caused by assuming the type of
service the Department will provide

PLAN SUBMITTALS
At the time of initial contact with a Department engineering office, please provide the following items:

a. A completed Service Planning Information sheet - see pages 1-19 and 1-20 for master copy with a
fillable PDF version available at www.ladwp.com/forms.

b. Electrical plans including load schedules, single-line diagrams, and equipment elevation drawings.
c. Plot, grading, elevation, and site improvement plans.

d. Any additional information requested by the service planner needed to assist the Department in
finalizing the customer's plans.

SERVICE CONFIRMATIONS AND FACILITIES REQUIREMENTS

a. For projects to be served underground, the Department will provide a construction drawing or other
documentation specifying the facilities that the customer must install on the customer’s premises to
accommodate the Department’s transformers, cables and any other equipment needed to supply the
customer’s load.

b. For projects to be served overhead, the Department will provide a written confirmation of the serving
pole and its location. The customer is responsible for designing and building the service entrance and
point of attachment facilities to meet the Department’s overhead service requirements. See Section 7
for the applicable design information.

APPLICATIONS FOR SERVICE

a. Customers must contact a Customer Service Branch Office to make application for electric service.
This should be done at the time of initial contact with an engineering office, or shortly after, to avoid
delays in establishing service.

b. For locations and telephone numbers of Department engineering offices, see page 1-3.
FEES AND CHARGES

Customers must make payment in full for all fees and charges assessed by the Department before
construction will be started or service will be established. Such fees and charges include but are not limited
to service application fees, charges for temporary services, charges for construction or relocation of
Department facilities, charges for line extensions or excess conductor allowances as specified in the Rules,
charges for interconnection of customer-owned generation facilities and charges for nonstandard
installations.

B. PLANNING ELECTRIC SERVICES (Cont.)

6. PERMITS AND INSPECTIONS

a.

The Department will energize a customer's electric service only after the installation has been
inspected and cleared by both the Department and the permitting agency.

Normally the following steps must be completed to establish electric service:
(1) An electrical permit must be obtained by the customer from the permitting agency.

(2) All site electrical wiring must be completed and inspected by the permitting agency and the final
electrical release cleared to the Department (notice is generally made by teletype or letter).

Note: It may take several days after the final permitting agency inspection for the Department to
be notified.

(3) All facilities specified by the Department must be inspected by the Department and all corrections
must be completed and approved. See page 1-24 for additional information.

7. SCHEDULING AND CONSTRUCTION

a.

When the required inspections have been completed and all fees and charges are paid in full, a
"release" will be sent to the appropriate Department service center for scheduling and construction.

Installation of facilities by the Department will normally be scheduled during regular working hours.
However, customers may request the Department to install facilities during premium (overtime) hours
for the convenience of the customer. Requests for premium time installations may be made by
contacting the appropriate engineering office. Customers are required to reimburse the Department for
all premium time charges.

The Department will make a reasonable effort to complete service installations as quickly as possible.
However, the time required to complete an installation will vary according to the complexity of the
service and the number of services already scheduled or under construction.

The following timelines are provided to assist customers in planning and scheduling projects for:

Underground residential services, see page 1-9.
Overhead residential services, see page 1-10.

C. ELECTRIC LOADS

1.

GENERAL

a. Motor or lighting loads may be supplied from any service of appropriate class, phase, and voltage.
However, such loads are subject to conditions or limitations specified in these service requirements and
the Department's Rules.

b. 120-volt single-phase loads must be reasonable balanced between phases with respect to the neutral,
and 240-volt single-phase loads must be reasonably balanced between the phases.

CHANGES IN CONNECTED LOAD

a. The customer shall provide written notice whenever a material change is made in the amount or
character of the customer’s electrical load, see page 1-19.

b. The Department is required to serve only the load initially approved and connected, or specified,
regardless of the rating of the service equipment or service disconnect.

c. When a customer proposes adding load to an existing service, the added load is considered to be a
new installation. The Department will consider the added loads on an individual basis and reserves the
right to require the customer to make changes in the existing service facilities, including provisions for
transformer facilities on the customer's premises.

INSUFFICIENT LOAD

The Department will normally energize a customer's service when there is sufficient load to justify
installation of the Department's facilities. When a customer requests the Department to supply service to a
facility where the load is insufficient to justify the Department’ investment, the customer will be required to
reimburse the Department for the excess investment required to supply the load, or provide suitable, and
mutually agreeable, guarantees that will warrant the Department's investment.

LOAD CHARACTERISTICS AFFECTING OTHER CUSTOMERS

Where, in the Department's judgment, the characteristics of a customer's load may impair service to other
customers, the Department may require that such loads to be supplied through a separate service, or that
the customer supply suitable equipment, at the customer's expense, to reasonably limit voltage fluctuations
caused by the equipment involved.

SINGLE-PHASE MOTORS

a. Motors operated at 120 volts are limited to a maximum locked-rotor current of 46 amperes, or a full-load
current of 12 amperes.

b. Motors operated at more than 120 volts are limited to a maximum locked-rotor current not exceeding
450-percent of the full-load running current. Where more than one motor is installed in a device, the
accumulated locked rotor currents shall be limited to 450-percent of the accumulated full-load running
currents.

THREE-PHASE MOTORS

a. The Department will generally supply three-phase service for motor loads totaling more than 5
horsepower (hp). While such installations are not generally limited to capacity either of individual
motors, or of the entire installation, the Department may require that large motor loads be supplied
from dedicated transformer facilities located on the customer's premises.

Gaseous tube lighting equipment or systems rated at 15 watts or more, and individual tube transformers

rated at 150 volt-amperes or more and used with gaseous tube systems or signs, must be power factor

corrected to 90-percent lagging or leading.
8. HEATING, COOKING AND MISCELLANEOUS LOADS

Single-phase commercial heating and cooking loads and other miscellaneous single-phase loads may, at

the option of the Department, be supplied through a three-phase service at 240 volts. Customers must

obtain approval from the Department if none of the individual loads is three-phase.

9. X-RAY UNITS OVER 5 KVA

Customers must obtain approval from the Department before installing x-ray equipment in units exceeding
5 kVA.

10. WELDERS
a. Customers must obtain approval from the Department before installing welders:
(1) Rated more than 3 kVA on any residential service.

(2) Rated 15 kVA or more on any commercial or industrial service. Welders rated more than 15 kVA
may require special serving facilities. Consult the Department for additional information.

b. Single-phase welders may be served through a three-phase service provided the loads are balanced. If
the loads cannot be balanced, customers must consult the Department regarding the maximum
allowable imbalance before service will be supplied. The two service entrance conductors supplying
the greatest single-phase load shall be tagged, or otherwise identified, at the point of connection before
service will be supplied.

D. INSPECTIONS

1.

GENERAL

a.

The Department will not energize any service or set any meter until the service and metering
equipment, conduit, and other facilities required by the Department have been inspected and approved
by the Department.

The Department policy is to provide inspection of the customer's facilities in a timely manner and
without causing unnecessary delays to the customer's construction schedule or service wanted date.
However, it is the customer’s responsibility to provide sufficient advance notice to the Department to
avoid delays caused by conflicts with inspection schedules already committed.

SCHEDULING INSPECTIONS

a.

To schedule an inspection, contact the appropriate engineering office. Department construction
drawings may specify a telephone number to contact for inspection.

Contractors should notify the Department at the beginning of construction at the job site. In addition,
contractors should request inspection as soon as facilities specified by the Department are ready for
inspection.

The following lead times are recommended when scheduling inspections:

(1) Service and metering equipment - 2 working days.

(2) Conduits and handholes - 2 working days.

(3) Vaults and pads - 5 working days.

Note: The Department's inspector is to be present while vaults and pads are being installed.

SPECIAL INSPECTIONS

J. CUSTOMER-OWNED GENERATORS

1. INTERCONNECTED GENERATORS

a.

Interconnected generators encompass any type of customer-owned generator or generating facility that
can electrically parallel with, or potentially back feed into, the Department’s electric system.
Additionally, generators using a closed-transition (“make-before-break”) type transfer switch or a multi-
breaker transfer scheme, or an electrical inverter that can be configured to operate in a utility
interactive mode constitute a potential back feed source into the Department's electric system and are
classified as interactive generators. No interconnected generating system shall be switched or
operated in parallel with the Department's electric system without the approval of the Department.

All interconnected generating systems shall be connected on the load side of the customer's meter
switch (main service disconnect device).

Exception: Some generating systems may be connected on the line side of the customer's
disconnecting means as permitted by City, State or National Electric Codes, see
GENERATORS AND GENERATING SYSTEMS, page 8-10.

The Department has specific Interconnection Requirements that must be complied with for all
interconnected generators. These include a visible open disconnect switch to isolate the Customer’s
system from the Department’s system, as well as protective relaying, metering, special rate schedules,
and other safety and information requirements. For additional information, see DESIGN GUIDE FOR
CUSTOMER-OWNED PARALLEL GENERATING SYSTEMS, page 8-1.

Anyone considering installing an interconnected generator should contact the Department for
information. See OFFICE LOCATIONS AND TELEPHONE ASSISTANCE, page 1-3.

2. EMERGENCY OR STAND-BY GENERATORS

a.

Customer-owned emergency or standby generators shall be connected on the load side of the
customer’s meter switch (main service disconnect device) and shall normally be switched using double-
throw switches, or automatic relays and switches, which isolate the load from the Department's electric
system before the customer's generator is connected to the load - this switching arrangement is
commonly referred to as open-transition or "break-before-make". When the Department's electric lines
are re-energized, the customer’s generator(s) shall be isolated from the load before the load is
reconnected to the Department's electric system.

Customers with critical loads, such as hospitals, that require periodic testing of their emergency or
standby generating systems without interruption to their loads may use an automatic transfer switch
that is capable of operating in both open and closed transition modes. For these types of transfer
switches, if the period of parallel operation is less than one second, the owner must sign a Certification
of Momentary Parallel Operation and Indemnification agreement. If the period of parallel operation is
greater than one second, the operation is considered an interconnected generating system and the
customer shall be required to provide a visible open disconnect switch to isolate the customer’s electric
system from the Department’s electric system. Customers shall not under any circumstances
connect a closed transition transfer switch to the Department’s electric system without the
express permission of the Department or energize an un-energized Department electric line.

Note: Closed-transition switches and programmable switches that can operate in either the open or
closed transition modes shall be automatic rather than manually operated. Switches shall be
certified by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory to fully comply with low or medium
voltage UL 1008 or UL 1008A standards for transfer switch equipment as applicable to grid
safety.

LADWP ELECTRIC SERVICE REQUIREMENTS PAGE 1-33

CITY OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER

GENERAL INFORMATION Date: 05-02-24

J. CUSTOMER-OWNED GENERATORS (Cont.)

Cc.

e.

Switching arrangements that require the customer to manually open the service disconnect switch in
addition to operating the generator disconnect switch in order to isolate the customer's load from the
Department’s electric system are not acceptable.

Note: Keyed Interlock or padlock schemes that are combined with this switching arrangement are
also not acceptable.

Switching arrangements that include a special purpose relay that automatically operates the service
disconnect and generator disconnect switches (Automatic Throw over) are allowed pending the
Department's review and approval of the customer’s operating scheme and equipment specifications.
The customer shall also submit to the Department an Automatic Transfer Functionality Test Report
indicating compliance with National standards for grid safety and appropriately field label any such
equipment prior to connecting it to the Department’s distribution system. Regardless of transition
mode, the Customer shall submit to the Department a signed Certification of Momentary Parallel
Operation and Indemnification agreement.

Portable generators are not designed or intended to be connected to a building’s permanent
wiring system, and shall not be connected to any such wiring unless a permanent and approved

open-transition transfer switch is used. Failure to use a transfer switch can result in a back feed
through a Department-owned transformer and be stepped up to a very high voltage. This can pose a
potentially fatal shock hazard to anyone working on or near power lines.

3. STAND-ALONE GENERATING SYSTEMS

Stand-alone generating systems shall not be installed or operated without the approval of the Department.

A. METER SOCKETS

1.

GENERAL

a.

Each customer shall be permitted to have only a single meter socket for each voltage and phase to be
metered. Sockets shall have the jaw arrangement specified for the voltage and phase to be metered
and an approved sealing ring. See page 2-5 for socket jaw arrangements.

For commercial and industrial multi-meter installations, no more than two meters shall be mounted on a
single removable panel unless the design permits replacement of individual meter sockets without
disturbing adjacent meters secured with sealing or locking rings.

For residential multi-meter installations, no more than one meter shall be mounted on a single
removable panel unless the design permits replacement of individual meter sockets without disturbing
adjacent meters secured with sealing or locking rings.

Whenever a single meter registers the current supplied to more than one residential occupancy, the
installation shall be considered a commercial installation for the purposes of these requirements unless
otherwise approved by the Department.

Meter sockets shall be designed in accordance with the latest revision of AEIC-IEEE-NEMA Standards
for Watt-hour Meter Sockets (ANSI C12.7) and Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Standard for Meter
Sockets (UL414). The socket rim to socket jaw clearance shall not be less than specified by ANSI
C12.7 (0.500 inch) or more than 0.690 inch.

Exception: The 0.690-inch dimension does not apply to transformer rated sockets or to ground or
neutral jaws of self-contained sockets.

Self-contained meter sockets shall be attached to the back wall of the socket enclosure or to a
stationary support connected to the enclosure, and attached to the meter panel to assure alignment of
the socket ring to the socket jaws and to prevent removal of the panel with the meter installed.

Instrument-transformer rated meter sockets shall be designed for back connection when installed on
hinged panels and for front connection when installed on non-hinged panels. Sockets shall be installed
with machine screws so the socket can be easily interchanged or replaced.

Note: Screws used to mount cast meter sockets to meter panels shall provide a 1/8” minimum
clearance between the screw head and the back of the meter socket ring.

Meter socket wire terminals shall be sized to accept wires without removing wire strands and shall not
be accessible with the meter installed.

Meter sockets may be either surface-mounted or semi-flush mounted.
All meter fittings shall be mounted on a substantial support in a true vertical position.
Meter sockets and test-bypass compartments shall be barriered from customer sections.

Meter sockets and installations not permitted:
(1) Ringless or gasketed type meter sockets.
(2) Lever bypass meter sockets.

(3) Fully plastered-in meter socket boxes.

Meter sockets in multi-meter installations shall be clearly and permanently identified with the address it
serves, as specified by the Department.

2. RESIDENTIAL SERVICES

a.

For residential self-contained metering applications, meter sockets shall have a maximum ampacity
rating that is less than the ampacity rating of the associated meter switch. The maximum ampacity
rating is 125% of the continuous-duty rating.

When the meter switch exceeds 225 amperes, but does not exceed 400 amperes, a self-contained
meter panel (class 320), current-transformer box, or switchboard service section shall be installed.

3. COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SERVICES

a.

For commercial and industrial applications, meter sockets shall have a continuous-duty rating of 100
amperes for meter switches rated up to 125 amperes (maximum) and a continuous-duty rating of 200
amperes for meter switches rated up to 250 amperes (maximum).

A standard (100 ampere) safety-socket box is required for installations where the maximum rating of
the meter switch does not exceed 125 amperes. The following exceptions permit the use of a
residential meter socket (i.e., meter socket without test-bypass blocks):

(1) Single-phase house lighting services in multiple-occupancy residential buildings where the house
service does not supply fire alarms or motor-driven equipment.

(2) Single-phase signboard services not having motor-driven equipment.

(3) Single-phase temporary services.
Note: Contractors should verify the Department's short-circuit contribution before installing a
combination meter/main residential panel for any temporary service.
(4) Single-phase cathodic protection services.

(5) Single-phase parking lot lighting or area lighting services.

(6) Single-phase CATV and similar services where the customer provides a backup power supply
with automatic switching. The Department shall not be responsible for notifying the customer of
scheduled meter tests or similar activities that require removal of the meter from the socket.

(7) Single-phase statistical meter socket for electric vehicle chargers.
Note: The exceptions above do not apply to 277-volt single-phase.
A heavy-duty (200 ampere) safety-socket box is required for installations where the maximum rating of

the meter switch exceeds 125 amperes, but does not exceed 250 amperes. See item 3b(6) above for
exception.

Where the maximum rating of the meter switch exceeds 250 amperes, a current-transformer box or a
switchboard service section with an instrument-transformer compartment is required.

A. MANUFACTURER’S DRAWINGS FOR APPROVAL

1.

Customers are required to consult the Department regarding all new switchboard installations and changes
in metering due to load additions or modifications to existing services.

The Department recommends that manufacturers submit drawings for any proposed switchboard sections
to the Department for review to determine whether the proposed equipment is correctly designed for the
application committed to the customer. However, manufacturers shall submit equipment drawings to
the Department before fabricating the following equipment:

a. All standard switchboard service sections manufactured to meet the Department’s current published
requirements (See pages 3-12 and 3-14 for typical metering arrangements).

Exception: Service sections rated up to 800 amperes that are mass produced and sold as warehouse
items do not require a switchboard drawing submittal.

b. All non-standard (not specifically covered in these requirements) switchboard metering sections and
pull sections.

Note: Submittals by manufacturers for approval of non-standard service equipment arrangements
shall be clearly identified as requests for variance. The areas of non-compliance shall be
clearly identified along with justifications for the variance request.

c. All busway service heads (See page 3-48 for construction details).

Drawings shall provide the following information:

a. Job Address (not delivery address).

b. Manufacturer's contact with email address, telephone and fax number.
c. Voltage, ampacity and short-circuit rating information.
d

Details of the equipment with panel layout, sectional view layout and dimensions; meter socket
arrangements, and appropriate ESR or EUSERC page references. Single-line type drawings are not
acceptable.

e. Any other information deemed necessary for approval of the drawing.

Mail four copies of switchboard drawings to the Service Planning, Customer Station design, Electric Vehicle
design or PV/BESS design office (Attention: Switchboard Review) located in the area where the service is
to be supplied. See page 1-4 for office locations, telephone numbers, and PAGE 1-5 for service planning
area boundaries. Note: customer station, electric vehicle and PV/BESS design groups do not have area
maps and handle projects throughout the City and in the Owens Valley.

Questions regarding drawing status should be made to the service planning office where the drawings are
submitted.

Switchboard approvals shall remain in effect for no more than 18 months after which time new drawings
shall be resubmitted for approval.

B. SWITCHBOARD SERVICE SECTIONS

TYPICAL SWITCHBOARD TERMINATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR OVERHEAD SUPPLY (Cont.)

Cable conductors should enter through the top (preferred point of entry) of the switchboard service section
(figure 1), or through the side or back of a top hat installed above the service section (figure 2) and terminate at
the top of the current-transformer bus units. If this is not practical, the conduits may, with Department approval,
enter through the side or back (See "alternate feed" in figure 1) in the sealable section above the instrument-
transformer compartment - for this type of entry, the top of the conduit shall not be more than three inches from
the top of the switchboard service section and the cables shall be installed to prevent turning or misalignment of
the current-transformer bus units.

Note: The cables shall not terminate on cross bussing or in any location behind or to the side of the current-
transformer mounting area (below the upper bus support bar).

Caution: The number of service entrance conductors permitted is limited at the weatherhead. See SERVICE
ENTRANCE CONDUCTORS, page 7-14.

Bus duct (figure 3) may enter either through the top of the switchboard service section, or at the side or back in
the sealable section above the instrument-transformer compartment.

A bussed top hat extension (figure 4) with cable terminating facilities is required when the Department installs
and terminates the conductors at the switchboard (i.e., typical of Indoor Customer Station installations). Consult
the Department regarding extension requirements.

NONSTANDARD TERMINATING PULL SECTIONS (Cont.)

For Figure 1 applications the customer must provide the dimension measured from the bottom of the pull
section to the top of the highest supply conduit when ordering the pull section to assure proper termination
height.

The terminating facilities shall be located as far forward (close to the pull section access cover panels) as
possible to provide for adequate cable bending radius.

Note: The minimum clearance from any energized part to a removable access cover panel shall be 4 inches.
This dimension may be reduced to 1-1/2 inches if a removable safety barrier is provided by the
manufacturer.

The shaded area is reserved for the Department's service supply conductors. No conduits or customer wiring
shall be installed in or routed through this area. No other conductors or ground connections shall be routed
through or terminated in this area. No customer-owned devices (i.e., fuses, cable limiters, surge arrestors,
current-transformers and other customer-owned devices) shall be installed anywhere in this section.

Cross-bussing of a different phase or potential installed behind or below any terminating position shall be fully
insulated or barriered. Insulating barriers shall be a rigid, nonflammable material rated for the serving voltage,
resistant to ARC tracking, resistant to puncture or damage by impact, and attached with non-conducting
fasteners.

The edges of the cable window between the entrance raceway and the pull section shall be rounded or

otherwise protected to prevent damage to the service supply conductors.

Note: The width of the cable window shall provide direct access to each specified cable terminating position
without bending around the window edges.

Conduits shall not enter the side of any pull section without the express permission of the Department. Side
entry conduits may require a wide pull section enclosure to assure adequate spacing for cable bending radius.

. Nonstandard terminating pull sections shall not be installed in conjunction with on-site transformer pad mount

and vault substructures.

Note: When it is necessary to locate the service below grade level and it is fed by either a substructure or
a pole, a double terminated pull section shall be required at grade level to prevent water intrusion into
the electrical room. A means of service disconnect shall not be allowed with this pull section unless: it is
also located adjacent to its related meter socket(s). Consult the Department for specific requirements.

J. HAZARDOUS (EXPLOSIVE ATMOSPHERE) AREA INSTALLATIONS

1.

GENERAL

a.

Metering equipment and terminating enclosures (i.e., pull boxes and pull sections) used for the
connection of the Department’s service supply conductors shall not be installed in locations that may
have ignitable levels of flammable vapors, gases, liquids or fibers present as defined in Sections 500
(division classifications) and 505 (zone classifications) of the latest editions of the City of Los Angeles
Electric Code, California Electric Code or the National Electric Code.

Note: The Department often terminates its supply conductors while energized and meters are always
tested under energized conditions. Both of these procedures can cause arcing conditions
leading to catastrophic results if performed in an explosive atmosphere.

The Department utilizes procedures (including duct sealing compounds) in some service installations to
inhibit the intrusion of explosive gases and vapors that may be present in the Department's
underground distribution system into the customer’s underground terminating enclosures. However,
the Department’s procedures do not meet the explosive gas mitigation methods approved by the City of
Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (DBS) or other permitting agencies and cannot be
used to meet the mitigation requirements of the customer’s building permit.

It is the customer’s responsibility to identify hazardous locations to the Department’s service planning
office and to design the service and metering facilities to avoid conflict with the Department's Electric
Service Requirements and the applicable City, State or National Electric Codes.

Meter and service facilities constructed in explosive atmosphere hazardous areas shall be relocated by
the customer at the customer’s expense to conform to the Department's requirements as well as the
applicable permitting agency’s requirements.

SERVICE STATIONS AND OTHER GASOLINE DISPENSING LOCATIONS

Service supply (lateral) conduits shall not be installed through any class 1, division 1 or 2 area. All
service cable terminating and metering facilities shall be located outside of the hazardous areas. The
areas classified as hazardous locations (see figure 1) are identified as follows:

a.

The area within an 18 inch radius measured from the outside of the gasoline dispensers and the area
within 18 inches of the ground surface and within a 20 foot radius of the gasoline dispensers as
measured from the outside of the dispensers.

The area within 18 inches of the ground surface and within a 5-foot radius from a tight fill connection
and a 10-foot radius from a loose fill connection as measured from each fill pipe provided for
underground gasoline storage tanks.

The area within 18 inches of the ground surface and within a 5 foot radius measured from each
ventilation opening provided for underground gasoline storage tanks.

The area below the surface of the hazardous areas identified above (a through c) is considered to be
Class 1, Division 1 (most restrictive). No limit is given for how far the hazardous area extends below
the surface.

HAZARDOUS (EXPLOSIVE ATMOSPHERE) AREA INSTALLATIONS (Cont.)

3. METHANE GAS HAZARD AREAS

a.

Methane is a naturally occurring volatile gas that may be present in the soil in varying concentrations
throughout the Los Angeles Basin. While a proposed development may be in a known Methane Zone
or Methane Buffer Zone, any lot or development site in the Los Angeles area may have methane
present and require mitigation measures as required by the City of Los Angeles Methane Ordinance.

It is the customer’s responsibility to determine the methane status of any proposed project and to
advise the Department of that status at the time the customer’s plans are submitted for review since the
presence of methane will directly affect the service design requirements specified by the Department’s
service planning offices.

Note: Site information for the methane status on some lots may be found on the Los Angeles
Department of Building and Safety (LADBS) website (www.ladbs.org) under zoning
information.

4. TYPICAL EQUIPMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR METHANE LOCATIONS

a.

While the Department utilizes mitigation procedures (including conduit sealing compounds) in some
service installations to inhibit the possible intrusion of explosive gases and vapors that may be present
in the Department’s underground distribution system into the customer’s underground service
terminating enclosures, these procedures do not meet the approved explosive gas mitigation methods
approved by the LADBS or other permitting agencies and cannot be used to meet the mitigation
requirements of the customer’s building permit.

Hazardous gas mitigation procedures, when required under the customer’s permit, shall be applied
between the service supply terminating enclosure and the associated metering equipment. Under no
circumstances shall customer-owned hardware used to mitigate hazardous gas be installed on or in
service supply conduits or underground service terminating enclosures.

Service termination enclosure locations:

(1) The Department’s underground service terminating enclosure (i.e., pull box or pull section) shall not
be installed within any building or building wall in any methane area, methane boundary area, or
other location that requires the installation of explosive gas seals or devices for compliance with the
City of Los Angeles Methane Ordinance.

Note: If the methane status of a site changes after the service supply terminating enclosure is
installed within a building or building wall and requires the installation of explosive gas
seals or devices, the terminating enclosure shall be relocated outside of the building or
building wall and the required gas mitigation devices shall be provided between the
terminating enclosure and the associated metering sections.

(2) Refer to the Department’s soil gas standard H-242 for acceptable distribution and service
equipment arrangements, gas levels and sealing requirements.

Underground service termination enclosures that are located on the outside wall outside of buildings
and not recessed in the wall or are padmounted may be installed as follows:

(1) For padmounted terminating enclosures installed away from buildings, a “double” switchboard pull
section may be installed to supply metering sections located within the buildings. The utility
termination section shall be built in compliance with ESR page 3-44, Figure 1. The customer load
wireway section may be sized to meet the customer’s wiring requirements.

(2) For padmounted terminating enclosures located on the exterior wall of a building, a single standard
pull section (ESR page 3-44) or pull box (ESR page 2-15 or 2-16) may be used with the service
entrance conductors exiting the enclosure above any terminating facilities provided in the

enclosure.

Note: Terminating enclosures and their associated supply conduits shall not be recessed within

the building wall.

(3) Refer to the Department’s soil gas standard H-242 for acceptable distribution and service

equipment arrangements, gas levels and sealing requirements.

e. For installations where methane mitigation standards require that the terminating enclosure be supplied
with vents or louver vented doors, such provisions shall be tamper resistant incorporating an inner
barrier designed to prevent intrusion and have a minimum NEMA rating of 3R for outdoor use.

5. ALTERNATIVE FUEL DISPENSING AND STORAGE TANK LOCATIONS

Service supply (lateral) conduits shall not be installed through any class 1, division 1 or 2 area. All
service cable terminating and metering facilities shall be located outside of the hazardous areas. Minimum
clearances for areas classified as hazardous locations for alternate fuel dispensing and storage tanks are
as follows:

05-02-24 DESIGN GUIDE FOR CUSTOMER-OWNED PARALLEL GENERATING SYSTEMS

A. INTRODUCTION

1.

This section is intended to assist Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (Department) customers in
the design and evaluation of utility interconnections for customer-owned parallel-generation, backup and
energy storage systems.

The Solar Incentive process has been separated from the solar interconnection process. For more
information regarding available solar programs visit www.ladwp.com/solar.

The interconnection of customer-owned parallel-generation requires the following before any construction
may begin:

a. An Interconnection Agreement (IA): See TYPICAL TIME-LINES FOR PARALLEL-GENERATION
INSTALLATIONS, pages 1-16 and 1-17 for contact information and INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS,
page 8-3 for details.

b. A Generation Interconnection Study: For aggregate parallel energy source capacities greater than
30kW, depending on available electric system (grid) capacity and line loading, a generation
interconnection study shall be required to determine if the Department will need to install additional
protective equipment, perform system modifications or upgrades at the customer’s expense. The
typical timeline for the generation interconnection study is 2-4 weeks. If the proposed aggregate
parallel energy source is greater than the 15% of the peak line loading or 100% of the minimum line
loading, dependent on generation system topology, a supplemental study shall be performed. The
typical timeline for the supplemental study is 2-4 weeks. If the proposed generation system fails the
supplemental study a detailed study shall be required. The typical timeline for the detailed study is 4-6
weeks.

Note: An interconnection study may result in lower capacity limitations than the maximum limits
established in PROTECTIVE SCHEMES, page 8-7. Regardless of the number of supply points,
these capacity limitations apply to the entire customer premises, see Glossary for definition of
Premises.

c. A Service Commitment: The Department will determine the method of interconnection and transmit
requirements to the customer in writing after appropriate engineering deposits and customer
submittals have been received by the Department. See DATA REQUIRED FOR DESIGN, page 8-2.

B. DATA REQUIRED FOR DESIGN

1.

When considering the installation of a parallel-generation and/or storage facility, customers must contact
the Department as soon as possible so that:

a. The Department's Service Planners can work with the customer to establish an acceptable
interconnection scheme for the customer’s facility.

b. Customers may avoid unnecessary expenses and delays in service caused by assuming deficient
interconnection schemes and equipment requirements.

At the time of initial contact, or as soon as possible, customers should provide the Department with the
following information so that the Department may assist the customer in finalizing the customer's plans:

a. Electrical plans including load schedules, single-line diagrams, Service Planning Information form (see
pages 1-19 and 1-20), and Supplemental Battery Energy Storage System Data sheet (if applicable).

b. Plot and site development plans showing generator, AC disconnect, metering equipment locations and
Department access to generator, AC disconnect and meter equipment locations.
c. Energy source information:
(1) Maximum kilowatt rating
(2) Nominal voltage output
(3) Voltage regulation
(4)

Maximum fault current contribution

CITY OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER

DESIGN GUIDE FOR CUSTOMER-OWNED PARALLEL GENERATING SYSTEMS Date: 05-02-24

B. DATA REQUIRED FOR DESIGN (Cont.)

d. Protective system information:
(1) Protective system plan
(2) Manufacturer's data sheets and maintenance requirements for protective equipment

(3) Any additional information required by the Department

3. Upon receiving the requested information and engineering fees, the Department will provide customer

requirements drawings and Department construction drawings as needed. Customer requirement
drawings provide the customer with the information necessary to construct the interconnection facilities for
the transformers, protective devices, meters and other necessary equipment that will be installed by the
Department.

C. ELECTRIC RATES

Rates for the sale or exchange of electrical energy between the Department and the customer shall be in
accordance with the established rates as specified in the effective Rate Ordinance(s) of the Department or by
contract.

D. INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS (IA)

1.

Customers are required to complete a Standard Offer Interconnection Agreement (Agreement) with the
Department before the generating and/or storage facility may be interconnected to the Department’s
electric system.

Customers seeking to interconnect a new Electrical Generation Facility associated with service according
to a Customer Generation (CG) rate shall be required to complete the Declaration of Ownership of
Electrical Generation Facility under a CG Rate form.

The Department normally uses a Standard Offer contract for Agreements. However, if the Standard Offer
is not suitable for the needs of the generating and/or storage facility, the customer may request the
Department to consider a separate nonstandard Agreement.

E. INTERCONNECTION COSTS

Customers are required to reimburse the Department for all expenses associated with completing the
interconnection of the customer’s parallel-generation facilities including, but not limited to, extensions or
modifications to the Department’s electric system and related facilities and construction costs.

F. TRANSFORMER REQUIREMENTS

1.

Energy sources rated less than 500kW may be connected on the secondary side of Department-owned
transformers supplied from the 4800-volt electric system.

Energy sources rated 500-750kW may be required to be connected on the secondary side of dedicated
Department-owned transformers supplied from the 34,500-volt electric system.

Energy sources rated over 750kW shall be required to be connected on the secondary side of dedicated
Department-owned transformers supplied from the 34,500-volt electric system. Transformers shall be
sized to supply the complete installation and will serve no other customer. Secondary distribution may be
provided at the most convenient serving voltage for the customer.

Feed-In-Tariff (FiT) solar energy source(s) rated 1,000kW and above may be connected to the secondary
side of Customer-owned transformers supplied from the 34,500-volt electric system. In these cases, the
generation meter shall be located between the Customer-owned transformer and Department-owned
system protection equipment. The metering equipment shall have a service class of 34,500-volts, Three-
Phase, Three-Wire. For additional information, see pages 4-21 through 4-36.

The Department may require that the Department-owned transformers used to supply the customer's
electric system be sized (i.e., kVA rating) equal to, or greater than, the customer's total generator capacity.

See TRANSFORMER INSTALLATIONS ON THE CUSTOMER’S PREMISES on page 1-33 for additional
information.

CITY OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER

05-02-24 DESIGN GUIDE FOR CUSTOMER-OWNED PARALLEL GENERATING SYSTEMS

G. OPERATING REQUIREMENTS

1.

Customers are required to operate customer owned generating and storage facilities, whether permanent
or temporary, in accordance with the Agreement, The Department’s Electric Service Requirements, Rules,
Rate Schedules and all other applicable Codes and Ordinances.

Customers shall not:

a. Energize an un-energized electric line or transformer.

b. Reconnect the energy source after a protective device trip unless the customer’s electric system is
energized by the Department’s electric system by the Department, or unless the customer’s electric
system is isolated from the Department’s electric system by the Department.

Note: Synchronous generators are capable of maintaining a distribution system energized even after the
line protective device has opened and separated (relayed) the line from the Department's electric
system. Since the Department uses automatic reclosing schemes to energize relayed lines after a
short time delay, customer-owned equipment or Department-owned equipment may be damaged if
power is restored to a line that is already energized by the customer’s generator(s).

These operating and protective requirements have been established to protect the health and well-being
of the public and utility workers from malfunctions in Department or customer equipment.

H. METERING

1.

4.

Customers shall provide Department approved metering arrangements for the installation of Department-
owned generation and generation performance (performance) meters to measure the energy into, or out of,
the installation at the interconnection point and at the energy source(s) output, respectively.

Exception: Provisions for a Department owned performance meter are no longer required for solar or
wind generating systems with an aggregate capacity of 30kW or less.

All metering equipment drawings must be submitted to, and approved by, the Department service planner
before the customer installs any equipment.

The performance meter as specified in these requirements is intended to measure the total output of the
customer's generating system. No customer load is permitted on the generating system side of the meter.

Exception: Optional customer installed device(s) used to monitor system performance are permitted
and are subject to the following conditions:

(1) Device(s) shall be co-located on the same side of the AC disconnect switch as its source
of power.

(2) A device(s) power source wiring shall not bypass or defeat any AC disconnect switch.

(3) A device(s) power source and low voltage data circuits shall not enter or pass through any
utility sealed section.

(4) Total device load shall not exceed 100 Watts.
Whether the service connection is overhead or underground:

a. The line side (top of meter) of the Department Revenue meter used for billing shall be connected to
Department side, and the load side (bottom of meter) shall be connected to the customer side (the
generation contribution side).

b. The connections of the performance meter are opposite to those of the revenue meter. The generation
contribution side is connected to the line side (top of meter) and the Department side is connected to
the load side (bottom of meter). Refer to drawings on pages 8-16 to 8-34.

DESIGN GUIDE FOR CUSTOMER-OWNED PARALLEL GENERATING SYSTEMS Date: 05-02-24

H. METERING (Cont.)

c. The service class of the performance meter shall match the output of the generation source as
measured by one of the Department’s standard metering configurations. See page 2-5 for standard
meter configurations.

Feed in Tariff (FiT) Generation - Use of current transformers applies to transformer rated meter
installations. In this case, the current transformer polarities shall be facing the Department grid. For a self-
contained FiT meter, the delivery direction for purpose of metering shall be from the Department grid to the
line side (top of meter), and the customer’s FiT from the load side (bottom of meter). The Department
shall specify the class of service available for interconnection. See pages 8-17 (figure 3) and 8-18 (figure 4)
for additional information.

Note: FiT generation taps shall not be made in any utility sealed section or compartment unless
approved by the Department.

Performance Meter Switchboard Review — Manufacturer's switchboard drawings shall be submitted to
the Department when the performance meter (regardless of ampacity) and the utility disconnect are
integrated into a single switchgear unit, see pages 3-3 and 4-2, Manufacturer’s Drawings for Approval.

|. INSPECTIONS

The Department requires that all conditions specified by these requirements be met and verified by the
Department. In addition, an approval from the permitting agency for portions of the wiring and electrical
equipment under their jurisdiction is required before the Department will establish the interconnection.

J. LIABILITY

1.

Customers are responsible for damage caused to Department-owned equipment or other customers
served from the Department's electric lines as a result of mis-operation or malfunction of the customer's
energy source system.

The Department does not assume any responsibility for the protection of the customer’s energy source(s)
or any other portion of the customer's electrical system. The customer is fully responsible for protecting the
customer's system so that faults or other disturbances on the Department’s system do not cause damage
to the customer’s equipment.

K. DISCONNECTION OF CUSTOMER’S ENERGY SOURCES

1.

GENERAL

In compliance with the Department’s Rules Governing Water and Electric Service, the Department reserves
the right to disconnect the customer's energy source(s) from the Department's electric system:

a. When the customer’s energy source is adversely affecting the Department’s electric system or other
customer’s supplied from the Department's electric system.

b. When the customer-installed protective system has been defeated or not properly maintained, (lack of
proper records is considered to be non-maintenance).

c. Ifthe customer denies access to the Department to the generating facility or to required maintenance
and operating records.

d. Under emergency conditions as determined by the Department.
NOTIFICATION

a. Under non-emergency conditions, generally a notice of disconnection will be provided in writing as
follows:

(1) For energy sources with an aggregate capacity of less than 500kW, the Department will endeavor
to provide notification 72 hours in advance of the scheduled disconnection.

(2) For energy sources with an aggregate capacity of 500kW or greater, the Department will provide
notification 72 hours in advance of the scheduled disconnection.

K. DISCONNECTION OF CUSTOMER’S ENERGY SOURCES (Cont.)

b.

Under emergency conditions, the Department reserves the right to disconnect the customer’s energy
source(s) without notification.

If the customer-installed protective system becomes inoperative, the customer shall disconnect the
energy source(s) from the Department’s electric system and immediately notify the Department. When
the protective system problems have been corrected, the customer shall request the Department for
permission to reconnect the customer generation system.

L. UTILITY DISCONNECTING MEANS
GENERAL

1.

a.

Customers shall furnish, install and maintain circuit disconnect switches as required by State or
National Electric Code and the Department to isolate the customer’s parallel generator, generating
and/or energy storage system from the Department’s electric system. In general, a parallel generator
AC disconnect switch and a generator circuit disconnect switch will be required for all synchronous
generating systems, while only a parallel generator AC disconnect switch will be required for induction
and inverter-based parallel generating systems. In general, an additional AC disconnect switch shall
be required for energy storage.

Note: A parallel energy source AC disconnect switch shall not isolate a customer’s load panel.

The Department AC Disconnect Switch shall be a safety switch with a readily verifiable visual air gap to
assure positive circuit disconnect and shall be lockable in the open (off) position with a Department
standard padlock having a 5/16-inch lock shaft and a 1-inch locking clearance.

Note: A disconnect or circuit breaker with rack-out capability shall not be used to provide a
readily verifiable visual air gap.

AC disconnect switches shall have the line side of the disconnect switch, that is the fixed portion of the
switch connected to the Department’s power system. The load side of the switch, that is the movable
portion of the switch (the blades) shall be connected to the side of the customer’s parallel-generation
contribution. The blade side of the switch shall contain the fuse, and the fuse shall be “cold sequence”
so the fuse shall be de-energized from the utility source for safety.

Note: Safety switches shall have a viewing window to allow verification of the open switch condition
without exposing the Department’s personnel to energized bus. The viewing window shall be
located on center no higher than 68 inches above the level standing and working space.
Removing customer-owned fuses shall not be permitted as a means of providing an air gap.

Exception: Unless otherwise requested by the Department, a viewing window is not required for wall
mounted safety switches if a visual air gap may be verified by way of a hinged cover, the
potential is less than 600 volts, and where the maximum short-circuit at the AC disconnect
is 22,000 amperes or less.

Six or more AC disconnect switches connected to any single service point shall be approved
by a Department engineer and may be limited by the City of Los Angeles Department of Building and
Safety, or other Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ).

A dedicated AC utility disconnect may not be required for inverter-based PV systems with total
combined aggregate capacities up to and including 30 kW AC per premises. A dedicated AC utility
disconnect may not be required for inverter-based Battery Energy Storage Systems with total combined
capacities up to and including 30 kW AC per premises. This includes single-phase and three-phase
systems. For example, a 30kW photovoltaic system could be installed without a utility disconnect
switch at the same premises as a 30kW battery energy storage system without a utility disconnect
switch, provided:

(1) The service supply voltage is less than 600 Volts and,
(2) The service main disconnect controls all power flow registered by the meter and,

(3) Energy sources are not connected to the meter panel through a line side tap and,

(4) The combination meter panel is of the ‘self-contained type’ commercial safety socket, residential
class 320 or less and,

(5) The service consists of no more than six self-contained type meters per premises and,

(6) The service is not fed from the Department’s 34.5kV sub-transmission system.

Note: Services that are converted to the Department’s 34.5kV sub-transmission system or exceed
the limits given above in the future shall require AC utility disconnects be installed for all
existing energy sources at the customer's expense.

Note: The Department may need to remove the revenue meter to disconnect the customer’s
energy sources when required under section page 8-5(K).

2. ACCESS

Switches used to disconnect the energy source shall be accessible under all conditions and at all times to
Department personnel. This may require disconnect switches to be located in a publicly accessible area or
be provided with an interlock system to gain access to an installation in a security-controlled area.

Exception: Parallel generating systems with an aggregated output capacity of 100kW or less per
property or premises as determined by the Department. In these cases, performance meters
and AC disconnect switches must be readily accessible and located on the exterior wall of a
building or other approved permanent structure, in an approved meter room on the ground
floor or first basement parking level or such other locations as the Department may designate.

M. SIGNS AND LABELS

1.

The customer shall provide and install the following signs as directed by the Department:

a. A sign at the main service (meter) panel location identifying each energy source AC disconnect

DESIGN GUIDE FOR CUSTOMER-OWNED PARALLEL GENERATING SYSTEMS Date: 05-02-24

T. GENERATORS AND GENERATING SYSTEMS (Cont.)

2.

Parallel generating systems may be connected on either the line side or load side of the customer’s service
disconnecting means as allowed by the permitting agency or other Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) but
are subject to the following restrictions:

a. Parallel-generation circuit connections may not be made in, or accessed through, any sealed utility
compartment.

Exception: Where metering equipment has been specifically designed and manufactured with a line
side tap terminating in a section that is accessible to the customer, and has been labeled
and certified by the manufacturer for the sole purpose of connecting parallel generating
systems.

b. Generation circuit conduits and conductors shall not be routed through any sealed utility compartment.

Note: sealed utility compartments include terminating pull boxes and pull sections, metering
compartments, and test-bypass compartments.

Caution: Existing service equipment may not have a suitable parallel-generation connection point on
the line side of the customer’s service over-current device and may require third party
certification of any proposed connection location. Consult with LADBS or other applicable
permitting agency regarding third party certification requirements.

Single-phase generation sources are limited to 30kW total capacity per premises unless dedicated on-site
transformation is provided. Installations with individual single-phase inverters greater than 30kW shall use
a three-phase interconnection system and balance the sources between the phases.

For synchronous generators, automatic synchronization is preferred. However, manual synchronization
with relay supervision is acceptable.

Synchronous generators designed to be started as induction motors may not require synchronizing relays,
but will not be permitted to start up if it results in detrimental effects to the Department’s electric system.

Voltage regulation equipment must be provided on the customer’s generator to maintain generation voltage
to within normal Department limits.

Induction generator installations may require capacitors to correct the power factor. Protection schemes
must be coordinated to ensure that the capacitors will always be disconnected before the induction
generator is disconnected.

Generator installations rated 750kW or less may be required by the Department to meet conditions and
specifications normally required for installations rated over 750kW. Safeguards that will be required and
the degree of sophistication will depend on the type of equipment and the interconnection scheme.

U. INVERTERS

Inverters may be used in customer generation systems that are interconnected with the Department's Electric
system (grid). An inverter shall:

1.

Be permanently utility interactive at the point of interconnection to the grid.

Exception: Inverters may function in “off-grid” mode during a utility outage under the following
circumstances:

a. The inverter supplies power to an outlet on the inverter unit that is accessible only to qualified service
personnel per UL1741SA standards. Warning: Outlet circuit shall not be integrated with the buildings
internal wiring system.

b. The inverter supplies power to charge a battery backup system to feed critical loads (See section V).

Hybrid inverters may be used, provided that any additional “off-grid” AC outputs are never connected
in parallel with the Department's grid.

10.

Systems with battery storage may require additional testing to confirm that the battery system, with the
utility side de-energized, provides power to the designated customer circuits only, and does not back feed
into the main panel (into the Department's grid).

Be certified by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory to fully comply with UL1741SA performance
and grid safety standards. The Certificate of Compliance should state that this utility interactive inverter met
all applicable requirements of current editions of UL1741SA and IEEE1547-2018/2020a, including testing
conformance to IEEE1547.1-2020. Also, refer to sections R and S (pages 8-9 & 8-10) for specification,
testing and evaluation requirements. All inverters shall be included in the California Energy Commission’s
(CEC) list.

Be accepted by the Department of Building and Safety, City of Los Angeles, or other Authority Having
Jurisdiction (AHJ).

Have safeguards to prevent power flow into un-energized Department’s electric system.

Have the voltage output match the electrical characteristics of the service provided by the
Department. For example, a single-phase inverter shall not be connected to a three-phase service, and an
inverter of one voltage class shall not be connected to a service of a different voltage class. See page 1-25
for available service classes.

Exception 1: Customer provides, at their expense, transformation between the performance meter and
NET energy or generation meter to match the electrical characteristics of the service
provided by the Department.

Exception 2: When connected to a three-phase service, three single-phase inverters may be used in lieu
of a three-phase inverter, provided that the customer maintains IEEE1547-2018/2020a
compliance by installing additional certified equipment to shut down all inverters in the
event of a “loss or open phase” event and maintain a balanced condition when connected
to a three-phase system.

Have an output that may be measured by a performance meter (see section H) conforming to one of the
Department’s standard meter configurations. See page 2-5 for standard meter configurations.

Operate as a current source rather than a voltage source; so that open-circuited inverter shall have an
output of zero volts. It shall only produce power output when it is connected to an energized Electric Power
System (EPS). The inverter’s voltage output will not be independent from the Department’s service supply
voltage, but it will be synchronized with it in such a way as to produce a current and power flow from the
Customer's parallel-generation into the Department’s power system (grid).

Operate within the Department's acceptable service supply voltage ranges. See Acceptable Voltage
Ranges, page 1-26 for additional information.

For the purposes of these requirements, be defined by its maximum continuous output power at unity
power factor.

Include a Utility Settings Compliance report indicating conformance with the Department’s UL1741SA
Smart Inverter Technical Requirements. This report shall be submitted to the Department upon request.

Battery Backup Systems

CITY OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER

Date: 05-02-24 DESIGN GUIDE FOR CUSTOMER-OWNED PARALLEL GENERATING SYSTEMS

NOTES:

1.

The customer shall furnish, install, and maintain all generation disconnect switches as required by the
Department.

a. An AC disconnect switch shall be located on the customers energy source side of the generation
performance meter. Consult with the Department for mounting heights and clearances.

b. Asingle fusible disconnect may be used in place of a separate circuit fuse and AC disconnect. The fusible
disconnect shall meet the same visual air gap and locking requirements as the AC disconnect and shall not
be used to isolate the customer’s load panel. See UTILITY DISCONNECTING MEANS, page 8-6 for
additional information.

The customer’s generating system circuit shall be connected on the load side of the customer’s main service
disconnecting means as shown in figures 1 to 5, and 7 to 24.

Exception: Parallel generating systems may be connected on the line side of the customer’s disconnecting
means as permitted by City, State or National Electric Codes. See GENERATORS AND
GENERATING SYSTEMS, page 8-10 for additional information.

The customer shall provide a meter socket for the installation of a Department performance meter. A
residential meter panel or a commercial safety-socket meter panel is required when the maximum output of the
generating system does not exceed 200 amperes. When the system output exceeds 200 amperes, a current-
transformer box or instrument-rated switchboard is required.

Note: The performance meter is intended to measure the total output of the customer’s generating system.
With the exception of monitoring equipment, no customer load is permitted on the generating system
side of the performance meter. Under certain circumstances, and if required to measure total
generation output, the Department may install additional performance meters at the customer's
expense. See METERING, page 8-4 for additional information.

Optional customer installed performance monitoring equipment may be installed with restrictions, see
METERING page 8-4. Customers who wish to monitor their generations performance should consider
consulting with their contractor for options when a Department supplied performance meter is not available.

The type of utility grid protection scheme required is dependent upon the size, type, and configuration of the
customer’s generation system, see PROTECTIVE SCHEMES page 8-7.

Customer provided real time production monitoring equipment may be required as specified by the Department,
see PROTECTIVE SCHEMES page 8-7.

Currently, customer loads shall not be supplied from a feed in tariff (FIT) system. The customer must apply for
a separate revenue meter and service from the Department.

An automatic transfer switch (ATS), manual transfer switch, or double throw safety switch shall be installed
between the customer’s backup system and the Department’s revenue meter, see BATTERY BACKUP
SYSTEMS page 8-12 and EMERGENCY OR STAND-BY GENERATORS page 1-32.

All systems that are designed to manage a customer’s peak energy demand shall be grid interactive, see
INVERTERS page 8-11. Shall not be used with Department Generation or NET energy metering, and shall not
allow for the export of energy to the Department’s grid. All related devices shall be connected on the load side
of the customer's main circuit breaker, see BATTERY PEAK SHAVING SYSTEMS page 8-13.

. Batteries shall not be located in the meter room. See pages 5-9 and 5-10 for more information. Contact the

Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (LADBS) or other Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) for
specific code requirements.

NOTES (Cont.):
11. Used for battery dispatch. No requirement at this time, standards are under development.

12. Anormally open, maintenance bypass mechanical interlock shall be installed on an emergency panel provided
it is affixed to the panel in a permanent, tamper-resistant fashion and is listed by a Nationally Recognized
Testing Laboratory (NRTL) as an interlock device.

Note: A double throw safety switch or ATS may also be used.

13. Battery energy storage system equipment that includes external isolation relays as part of an integral system
shall be certified by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) to comply with the UL 9540 standard.

EUSERC/ESR CROSS REFERENCE AND ACCEPTABILITY INDEX (Cont.)

The following is an explanation of the Consult (C) references shown in the preceding Table:

ESR EUSERC

PAGE DRAWING DESCRIPTION

2-12 347 The EUSERC Drawing includes an exception to Note 1 that permits edge-wise
terminating facilities to have 9/16-inch holes in place of the studs. The
Department does not allow back-to-back termination option shown in Figure 3.

2-15 344 The Department’s requirement has a different conduit range and specifies a
pull box size for 5-inch conduit.

2-28 305A The Department requires a one inch (minimum) dimension from the edge of
the compartment access opening to the test-bypass block insulator.

2-36 314 When used as a terminating pull box, the Department limits the service
capacity to 400 amperes.

2-41 328B The Department restricts this current-transformer mounting base application to
overhead supply only. Overhead supply means a top supply conduit entry
from a weatherhead or a separate underground pull box.

2-43 329B The Department restricts this current-transformer mounting base application to
overhead supply only. Overhead supply means a top supply conduit entry
from a weatherhead or a separate underground pull box.

3-12 325 The upper and lower CT compartment flanges are limited to a maximum
dimension of 1-1/4”.

3-14 326 The upper and lower CT compartment flanges are limited to a maximum
dimension of 1-1/4”.

3-16 332 The Department requires the removable mounting plate to be drilled to % inch.

3-38 354 The Department has more specific requirements for door hold-open devices.

3-40 348 The Department’s requirement includes specifications for switchboards
supplied from bus duct and bussed top hat enclosures.

3-48 349 For Customer Station applications, the Department requires one landing
position for each 400 amperes of service capacity.

4-6 401 The Department requirement is limited to 5 KV installations and includes
expanded and more detailed notes. The Department does not allow for the
current transformer compartment to be used as a cable termination section.

4-12 411 The Department requirement is limited to 5 KV installations and includes
