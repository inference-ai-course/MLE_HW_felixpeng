The framework employs a leader-follower game model with an adaptive role mechanism to predict human interaction intentions and behaviors. It then utilizes a branch model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to plan the AV trajectory, persuading the human to adopt the desired intention. The proposed framework is demonstrated in an intersection scenario.

    "title": "Hierarchical Game-Based Multi-Agent Decision-Making for Autonomous\n  Vehicles",
    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Hierarchical Game-Based Multi-Agent Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper develops a game-theoretic decision-making framework for autonomous driving in multi-agent scenarios. A novel hierarchical game-based decision framework is developed for the ego vehicle. This framework features an interaction graph, which characterizes the interaction relationships between the ego and its surrounding traffic agents (including AVs, human driven vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles, and others), and enables the ego to smartly select a limited number of agents as its game players. Compared to the standard multi-player games, where all surrounding agents are considered as game players, the hierarchical game significantly reduces the computational complexity. In addition, compared to pairwise games, the most popular approach in the literature, the hierarchical game promises more efficient decisions for the ego (in terms of less unnecessary waiting and yielding). To further reduce the computational cost, we then propose an improved hierarchical game, which decomposes the hierarchical game into a set of sub-games. Decision safety and efficiency are analyzed in both hierarchical games. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks, with an intersection-crossing scenario as a case study.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\nTitle:The impact of large-scale EV charging on the real-time operation of distribution systems: A comprehensive review\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:With the large-scale integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the distribution grid, the unpredictable nature of EV charging introduces considerable uncertainties to the grid's real-time operations. This can exacerbate load fluctuations, compromise power quality, and pose risks to the grid's stability and security. However, due to their dual role as controllable loads and energy storage devices, EVs have the potential to mitigate these fluctuations, balance the variability of renewable energy sources, and provide ancillary services that support grid stability. By leveraging the bidirectional flow of information and energy in smart grids, the adverse effects of EV charging can be minimized and even converted into beneficial outcomes through effective real-time management strategies. This paper explores the negative impacts of EV charging on the distribution system's real-time operations and outlines methods to transform these challenges into positive contributions. Additionally, it provides an in-depth analysis of the real-time management system for EV charging, focusing on state estimation and management strategies.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

However, maintaining optimal indoor climates requires significant energy and resources, making advanced control systems critical for economic viability and environmental sustainability. Traditional greenhouse models are often complex and imprecise, limiting the effectiveness of conventional control strategies. To address these challenges, this study investigates data-driven predictive control methods using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Our experiments showed that GRU-based predictive control reduced temperature and humidity violations by up to 5\\% and required 40\\% less computation time than the LSTM approach, all while maintaining equivalent economic performance and crop yield. These findings demonstrate that GRU-based predictive control offers a more efficient and practical solution for real-time greenhouse climate regulation in precision agriculture.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Emmanuel Arnaud Soumo [view email][v1] Tue, 29 Jul 2025 10:26:27 UTC (5,594 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The DNN is used to compensate the unknown nonlinear dynamics with higher accuracy than shallow neural networks (NNs) and SMC ensures robust tracking. This framework employs restricted potential functions within a set-theoretic paradigm to ensure system trajectories remain bounded within a compact set, improving robustness against approximation errors and external disturbances. The control scheme is grounded in non-smooth Lyapunov stability theory, with update laws derived for both inner and outer layer network weights of DNN. A numerical example is simulated that showcases the proposed controller's effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Physics > Medical Physics\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\nTitle:A Graphical Method for Designing Time-Optimal Non-Cartesian Gradient Waveforms\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:One of the fundamental challenges for non-Cartesian MRI is the need of designing time-optimal and hardware-compatible gradient waveforms for the provided $k$-space trajectory. Currently dominant methods either work only for certain trajectories or require significant computation time. In this paper, we aim to develop a fast general method that is able to generate time-optimal gradient waveforms for arbitrary non-Cartesian trajectories satisfying both slew rate and gradient constraints. In the proposed method, the gradient waveform is projected into a space defined by the gradients along the spatial directions, termed as $g$-space. In the constructed $g$-space, the problem of finding the next gradient vector given the current gradient vector under desired slew rate limit and with desired direction is simplified to finding the intersection between a line and a circle. To handle trajectories with increasing curvature, a Forward and Backward Sweep (FBS) strategy is introduced, which ensures the existence of the solution to the above mentioned geometry problem for arbitrary trajectories. Furthermore, trajectory reparameterization is proposed to ensure trajectory fidelity. We compare the proposed method with the previous optimal-control method in simulations and validate its feasibility for real MR acquisitions in phantom and human knee for a wide range of non-Cartesian trajectories. The proposed method enables accurate and fast gradient waveform design, achieving significant reduction in computation time and slew rate overshoot compared to the previous method. The source code will be publicly accessible upon publication of this study.\nCurrent browse context:\nphysics.med-ph\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The algorithm first decomposes the full problem into a reduced master problem and subproblems using Adaptive Benders decomposition. The subproblems are then solved by an enhanced SDDP. The enhancement includes (1) valid bounds at each iteration, (2) a path exploration rule, (3) cut sharing among subproblems, and (4) guaranteed {\\delta}-optimal convergence. The cuts for the subproblems are then shared by calling adaptive oracles. The key contribution of the paper is the first algorithm for solving this class of problems. The algorithm is demonstrated on a power system investment planning problem with multi-timescale uncertainty. The case study results show that (1) the proposed algorithm can efficiently solve this type of problem, (2) deterministic wind modelling underestimate the objective function, and (3) stochastic modelling of wind leads to different investment decisions.\nCurrent browse context:\nmath.OC\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Mathematics > Optimization and Control\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Decentralized Modeling of Vehicular Maneuvers and Interactions at Urban Junctions\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Modeling and evaluation of automated vehicles (AVs) in mixed-autonomy traffic is essential prior to their safe and efficient deployment. This is especially important at urban junctions where complex multi-agent interactions occur. Current approaches for modeling vehicular maneuvers and interactions at urban junctions have limitations in formulating non-cooperative interactions and vehicle dynamics within a unified mathematical framework. Previous studies either assume predefined paths or rely on cooperation and central controllability, limiting their realism and applicability in mixed-autonomy traffic. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a modeling framework for trajectory planning and decentralized vehicular control at urban junctions. The framework employs a bi-level structure where the upper level generates kinematically feasible reference trajectories using an efficient graph search algorithm with a custom heuristic function, while the lower level employs a predictive controller for trajectory tracking and optimization. Unlike existing approaches, our framework does not require central controllability or knowledge sharing among vehicles. The vehicle kinematics are explicitly incorporated at both levels, and acceleration and steering angle are used as control variables. This intuitive formulation facilitates analysis of traffic efficiency, environmental impacts, and motion comfort. The framework's decentralized structure accommodates operational and stochastic elements, such as vehicles' detection range, perception uncertainties, and reaction delay, making the model suitable for safety analysis. Numerical and simulation experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate the framework's capability in modeling accurate and realistic vehicular maneuvers and interactions at various urban junctions, including unsignalized intersections and roundabouts.\nCurrent browse context:\nmath.OC\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "On Policy Stochasticity in Mutual Information Optimal Control of Linear\n  Systems",
    "abstract": "Mathematics > Optimization and Control\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\nTitle:On Policy Stochasticity in Mutual Information Optimal Control of Linear Systems\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In recent years, mutual information optimal control has been proposed as an extension of maximum entropy optimal control. Both approaches introduce regularization terms to render the policy stochastic, and it is important to theoretically clarify the relationship between the temperature parameter (i.e., the coefficient of the regularization term) and the stochasticity of the policy. Unlike in maximum entropy optimal control, this relationship remains unexplored in mutual information optimal control. In this paper, we investigate this relationship for a mutual information optimal control problem (MIOCP) of discrete-time linear systems. After extending the result of a previous study of the MIOCP, we establish the existence of an optimal policy of the MIOCP, and then derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the optimal policy becomes stochastic and deterministic. Furthermore, we also derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the policy obtained by an alternating optimization algorithm becomes stochastic and deterministic. The validity of the theoretical results is demonstrated through numerical experiments.\nCurrent browse context:\nmath.OC\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

However, comparatively little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Ensemble Control of Stochastic Oscillators via Periodic and Feedback Control\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:We address the problem of steering the phase distribution of oscillators all receiving the same control input to a given target distribution. In a large population limit, the distribution of oscillators can be described by a probability density. Then, our problem can be seen as that of ensemble control with a constraint on the steady-state density. In particular, we consider the case where oscillators are subject to stochastic noise, for which the theoretical understanding is still lacking. First, we characterize the reachability of the phase distribution under periodic feedforward control via the Fourier coefficients of the target density and the phase sensitivity function of oscillators. This enables us to design a periodic input that makes the stationary distribution of oscillators closest to the target by solving a convex optimization problem. Next, we devise an ensemble control method combining periodic and feedback control, where the feedback component is designed to accelerate the convergence of the distribution of oscillators. We exhibit some convergence results for the proposed method, including a result that holds even under measurement errors in the phase distribution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a numerical example.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Machine Learning\n[Submitted on 29 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Systolic Array-based Accelerator for State-Space Models\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving differential equations through continuous integration, making training and inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around ~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel operations.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Robotics\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Projecting the New Body: How Body Image Evolves During Learning to Walk with a Wearable Robot\nView PDFAbstract:Advances in wearable robotics challenge the traditional definition of human motor systems, as wearable robots redefine body structure, movement capability, and perception of their own bodies. We measured gait performance and perceived body images via Selected Coefficient of Perceived Motion, SCoMo, after each training session. Based on human motor learning theory extended to wearer-robot systems, we hypothesized that learning the perceived body image when walking with a robotic leg co-evolves with the actual gait improvement and becomes more certain and more accurate to the actual motion. Our result confirmed that motor learning improved both physical and perceived gait pattern towards normal, indicating that via practice the wearers incorporated the robotic leg into their sensorimotor systems to enable wearer-robot movement coordination. However, a persistent discrepancy between perceived and actual motion remained, likely due to the absence of direct sensation and control of the prosthesis from wearers. Additionally, the perceptual overestimation at the later training sessions might limit further motor improvement. These findings suggest that enhancing the human sense of wearable robots and frequent calibrating perception of body image are essential for effective training with lower limb wearable robots and for developing more embodied assistive technologies.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.RO\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Mathematics > Optimization and Control\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Sliding Mode Control for Uncertain Systems with Time-Varying Delays via Predictor Feedback and Super-Twisting Observer\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper introduces a novel stabilization control strategy for linear time-invariant systems affected by known time-varying measurement delays and matched unknown nonlinear disturbances, which may encompass actuator faults. It is considered that part of the state vector is not available for real-time measurement. To address this, the proposed approach combines an open-loop predictor with a state observer designed using the Super-Twisting Algorithm, aiming to compensate for the delays and estimate the unmeasured state components. Specifically, the nonlinear observer-based framework enables the reconstruction of unmodeled fault signals without assuming that they originate from a known exogenous system, offering robustness against parametric uncertainties. Meanwhile, the predictor forwards the delayed output in time. Subsequently, a sliding mode control law is formulated to enforce an ideal sliding mode and ensure global stabilization, even under a broader class of perturbations, unmodeled disturbances, parametric uncertainties, and delays, owing to the integration of the Super-Twisting observer. Numerical simulations illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Tiago Roux Oliveira [view email][v1] Mon, 28 Jul 2025 19:05:59 UTC (674 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\nmath.OC\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation, transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior, demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for versatile robotic manipulation.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.RO\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

However, most studies are based on the phasor method and focused on the steady-state analysis, which may overlook the transient process of systems. Accordingly, inspired by the notion of coordinate transformation in the field of motor drive, this work develops a dq modeling method for SP compensated WPT systems. The proposed model effectively characterizes first-order system dynamics, facilitating enhanced measurement precision and control system development. One measurement application, dq model-based mutual inductance identification, is presented to reflect the value of the dq model. Simulation results are shown to validate the model's effectiveness, indicating that the developed model can be a good tool for the design of SP compensated WPT systems.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Minimum Attention Control (MAC) in a Receding Horizon Framework with Applications\nView PDFAbstract:Minimum Attention Control (MAC) is a control technique that provides minimal input changes to meet the control objective. Mathematically, the zero norm of the input changes is used as a constraint for the given control objective and minimized with respect to the process dynamics. In this paper, along with the zero norm constraint, stage costs are also considered for reference tracking in a receding horizon framework. For this purpose, the optimal inputs of the previous horizons are also considered in the optimization problem of the current horizon. An alternating minimization algorithm is applied to solve the optimization problem (Minimum Attention Model Predictive Control (MAMPC)). The outer step of the optimization is a quadratic program, while the inner step, which solves for sparsity, has an analytical solution. The proposed algorithm is implemented on two case studies: a four-tank system with slow dynamics and a fuel cell stack with fast dynamics. A detailed comparative study of the proposed algorithm with standard MPC indicates sparse control actions with a tradeoff in the tracking error.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Ganesh Teja Theertham Mr. [view email][v1] Mon, 28 Jul 2025 13:41:36 UTC (283 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\nTitle:UAV-Borne Digital Radar System for Coherent Multistatic SAR Imaging\nView PDFAbstract:Advancements in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology have enabled higher sampling rates, making it feasible to adopt digital radar architectures that directly sample the radio-frequency (RF) signal, eliminating the need for analog downconversion. This digital approach supports greater flexibility in waveform design and signal processing, particularly through digital modulation schemes like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This paper presents a digital radar system mounted on an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), which employs OFDM waveforms for coherent multistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging in the L-band. The radar setup features a primary UAV node responsible for signal transmission and monostatic data acquisition, alongside secondary nodes that operate in a receive-only mode. These secondary nodes capture the radar signal reflected from the scene as well as a direct sidelink signal. RF signals from both the radar and sidelink paths are sampled and processed offline. To manage data storage efficiently, a trigger mechanism is employed to record only the relevant portions of the radar signal. The system maintains coherency in both fast-time and slow-time domains, which is essential for multistatic SAR imaging. Because the secondary nodes are passive, the system can be easily scaled to accommodate a larger swarm of UAVs. The paper details the full signal processing workflow for both monostatic and multistatic SAR image formation, including an analysis and correction of synchronization errors that arise from the uncoupled operation of the nodes. The proposed coherent processing method is validated through static radar measurements, demonstrating coherency achieved by the concept. Additionally, a UAV-based bistatic SAR experiment demonstrates the system's performance by producing high-resolution monostatic, bistatic, and combined multistatic SAR images.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Beyond Line-of-Sight: Cooperative Localization Using Vision and V2X Communication\nView PDFAbstract:Accurate and robust localization is critical for the safe operation of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), especially in complex urban environments where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are unreliable. This paper presents a novel vision-based cooperative localization algorithm that leverages onboard cameras and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to enable CAVs to estimate their poses, even in occlusion-heavy scenarios such as busy intersections. In particular, we propose a novel decentralized observer for a group of connected agents that includes landmark agents (static or moving) in the environment with known positions and vehicle agents that need to estimate their poses (both positions and orientations). Assuming that (i) there are at least three landmark agents in the environment, (ii) each vehicle agent can measure its own angular and translational velocities as well as relative bearings to at least three neighboring landmarks or vehicles, and (iii) neighboring vehicles can communicate their pose estimates, each vehicle can estimate its own pose using the proposed decentralized observer. We prove that the origin of the estimation error is locally exponentially stable under the proposed observer, provided that the minimal observability conditions are satisfied. Moreover, we evaluate the proposed approach through experiments with real 1/10th-scale connected vehicles and large-scale simulations, demonstrating its scalability and validating the theoretical guarantees in practical scenarios.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin Reduced Order Models for fluid flows governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations\nView PDFAbstract:This research paper investigates the Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (APG) method for reduced order models (ROM) and fluid dynamics governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM, derived using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, demonstrates superior accuracy and stability compared to standard Galerkin ROMs. However, challenges arise due to the time invariance of the test basis vectors, resulting in high computational requirements. To address this, we introduce a new efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (eAPG) ROM formulation, extending its application to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by exploiting the polynomial structure inherent in these equations. The offline and online phases partition eliminates the need for repeated test basis vector evaluations. This improves computational efficiency in comparison to the general Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM formulation. A novel approach to augmenting the memory length, a critical factor influencing the stability and accuracy of the APG-ROM, is introduced, employing a data-driven optimization. Numerical results for the 3D turbulent flow around a circular cylinder demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Error measures and computational cost evaluations, considering metrics such as floating point operations and simulation time, provide a comprehensive analysis.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Kamil David Sommer [view email][v1] Mon, 28 Jul 2025 11:43:01 UTC (4,866 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nChange to browse by:\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Mathematics > Optimization and Control\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Fundamental diagram constrained dynamic optimal transport via proximal splitting methods\nView PDFAbstract:Optimal transport has recently been brought forward as a tool for modeling and efficiently solving a variety of flow problems, such as origin-destination problems and multi-commodity flow problems. Although the framework has shown to be effective for many large scale flow problems, the formulations typically lack dynamic properties used in common traffic models, such as the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model. In this work, we propose an optimal transport framework that includes dynamic constraints specified by the fundamental diagram for modeling macroscopic traffic flow. The problem is cast as a convex variant of dynamic optimal transport, with additional nonlinear temporal-spatial inequality constraints of momentum, modeled after the fundamental diagram from traffic theory. This constraint imposes a density-dependent upper bound on the admissible flux, capturing flow saturation and congestion effects, and thus leaves space for kinetic optimization. The formulation follows the Benamou-Brenier transportation rationale, whereby kinetic energy over density and momentum fields is optimized subject to the mass conservation law. We develop proximal splitting methods, namely the Douglas-Rachford and Chambolle-Pock algorithms, which exploit the separable structure of the constraint set and require only simple proximal operations, and can accommodate additional (time-varying) spatial restrictions or obstacles. Numerical experiments illustrate the impact of the constraint on transport behavior, including congestion-aware spreading, rerouting, and convergence. The framework establishes a connection between optimal transport and macroscopic traffic flow theory and provides a scalable, variational tool for modeling congestion-constricted (or saturation-aware) Wasserstein gradient flow.\nCurrent browse context:\nmath.OC\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

For automated driving systems, in particular, further assurance challenges result from the open context that the systems need to operate in after deployment. The current standardization and regulation landscape for ``AI-based'' systems is becoming ever more complex, as standards and regulations are being released at high frequencies.\nThis position paper seeks to provide guidance for making qualified arguments which standards should meaningfully be applied to (``AI-based'') automated driving systems. Furthermore, we argue for clearly differentiating sources of risk between AI-specific and general uncertainties related to the open context. In our view, a clear conceptual separation can help to exploit commonalities that can close the gap between system-level and AI-specific safety analyses, while ensuring the required rigor for engineering safe ``AI-based'' systems.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Convergent Weight and Activation Dynamics in Memristor Neural Networks\nView PDFAbstract:Convergence of dynamic feedback neural networks (NNs), as the Cohen-Grossberg, Hopfield and cellular NNs, has been for a long time a workhorse of NN theory. Indeed, convergence in the presence of multiple stable equilibrium points (EPs) is crucial to implement content addressable memories and solve several other signal processing tasks in real time. There are two typical ways to use a convergent NN, i.e.: a) let the activations evolve while maintaining fixed weights and inputs (activation dynamics) or b) adapt the weights while maintaining fixed activations (weight dynamics). As remarked in a seminal paper by Hirsch, there is another interesting possibility, i.e., let the neuron interconnection weights evolve while simultaneously running the activation dynamics (weight-activation dynamics). The weight-activation dynamics is of importance also because it is more plausible than the other two types for modeling neural systems. The paper breaks new ground by analyzing for the first time in a systematic way the convergence properties of the weight-activation dynamics for a class of memristor feedback dynamic NNs. The main result is that, under suitable assumptions on the structure of the memristor interconnections, the solutions (weights and activations) converge to an EP, except at most for a set of initial conditions with zero measure. The result includes the most important case where the NN has multiple stable EPs.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Energy management systems oversee their operation, deciding the set points of the primary control layer. This paper presents a novel 2-stage economic model predictive controller for electrified buildings including physics-based models of the battery degradation and thermal systems. The hierarchical control operates in the Dutch sequential energy markets. In particular common assumptions regarding intra-day markets (auction and continuous-time) are discussed as well as the coupling of the different storage systems. The best control policy is to co-optimize day-ahead and intra-day auctions in the first stage, to later follow intra-day auctions. If no intra-day prices are known at the time of the day-ahead auction, its best to follow continuous time intra-day in the summer and the intra-day auction in the winter. Additionally, this sequential operation increases battery degradation. Finally, under our controller the realized short-term flexibility of the thermal energy storage is marginal compared to the flexibility delivered by static battery pack and electric vehicles with bidirectional charging.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Dario Slaifstein [view email][v1] Mon, 28 Jul 2025 08:35:25 UTC (2,417 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Signal Processing\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Real-Time Distributed Optical Fiber Vibration Recognition via Extreme Lightweight Model and Cross-Domain Distillation\nView PDFAbstract:Distributed optical fiber vibration sensing (DVS) systems offer a promising solution for large-scale monitoring and intrusion event recognition. However, their practical deployment remains hindered by two major challenges: degradation of recognition accuracy in dynamic conditions, and the computational bottleneck of real-time processing for mass sensing data. This paper presents a new solution to these challenges, through a FPGA-accelerated extreme lightweight model along with a newly proposed knowledge distillation framework. The proposed three-layer depthwise separable convolution network contains only 4141 parameters, which is the most compact architecture in this field to date, and achieves a maximum processing speed of 0.019 ms for each sample covering a 12.5 m fiber length over 0.256 s. This performance corresponds to real-time processing capabilities for sensing fibers extending up to 168.68 km. To improve generalizability under changing environments, the proposed cross-domain distillation framework guided by physical priors is used here to embed frequency-domain insights into the time-domain model. This allows for time-frequency representation learning without increasing complexity and boosts recognition accuracy from 51.93% to 95.72% under unseen environmental conditions. The proposed methodology provides key advancements including a framework combining interpretable signal processing technique with deep learning and a reference architecture for real-time processing and edge-computing in DVS systems, and more general distributed optical fiber sensing (DOFS) area. It mitigates the trade-off between sensing range and real-time capability, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical deployment requirements. Furthermore, this work reveals a new direction for building more efficient, robust and explainable artificial intelligence systems for DOFS technologies.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SP\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\nTitle:A Modified Adaptive Data-Enabled Policy Optimization Control to Resolve State Perturbations\nView PDFAbstract:This paper proposes modifications to the data-enabled policy optimization (DeePO) algorithm to mitigate state perturbations. DeePO is an adaptive, data-driven approach designed to iteratively compute a feedback gain equivalent to the certainty-equivalence LQR gain. Like other data-driven approaches based on Willems' fundamental lemma, DeePO requires persistently exciting input signals. However, linear state-feedback gains from LQR designs cannot inherently produce such inputs. To address this, probing noise is conventionally added to the control signal to ensure persistent excitation. However, the added noise may induce undesirable state perturbations. We first identify two key issues that jeopardize the desired performance of DeePO when probing noise is not added: the convergence of states to the equilibrium point, and the convergence of the controller to its optimal value. To address these challenges without relying on probing noise, we propose Perturbation-Free DeePO (PFDeePO) built on two fundamental principles. First, the algorithm pauses the control gain updating in DeePO process when system states are near the equilibrium point. Second, it applies a multiplicative noise, scaled by a mean value of $1$ as a gain for the control signal, when the controller converges. This approach minimizes the impact of noise as the system approaches equilibrium while preserving stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PFDeePO through simulations, showcasing its ability to eliminate state perturbations while maintaining system performance and stability.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\nTitle:HJB-based online safety-embedded critic learning for uncertain systems with self-triggered mechanism\nView PDFAbstract:This paper presents a learning-based optimal control framework for safety-critical systems with parametric uncertainties, addressing both time-triggered and self-triggered controller implementations. First, we develop a robust control barrier function (RCBF) incorporating Lyapunov-based compensation terms to rigorously guarantee safety despite parametric uncertainties. Building on this safety guarantee, we formulate the constrained optimal control problem as the minimization of a novel safety-embedded value function, where the RCBF is involved via a Lagrange multiplier that adaptively balances safety constraints against optimal stabilization objectives. To enhance computational efficiency, we propose a self-triggered implementation mechanism that reduces control updates while maintaining dual stability-safety guarantees. The resulting self-triggered constrained Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is solved through an online safety-embedded critic learning framework, with the Lagrange multiplier computed in real time to ensure safety. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving both safety and control performance.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Zhanglin Shangguan [view email][v1] Mon, 28 Jul 2025 06:06:39 UTC (998 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Robotics\n[Submitted on 28 Jul 2025]\nTitle:LLMs-guided adaptive compensator: Bringing Adaptivity to Automatic Control Systems with Large Language Models\nView PDFAbstract:With rapid advances in code generation, reasoning, and problem-solving, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in robotics. Most existing work focuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have explored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts are restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and lack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control, this work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework of model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive compensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead, the LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a reference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the unknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity. Experiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided adaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive control, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world environments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms traditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity compared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and reasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator enables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical derivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability, adaptability, and robustness. This study opens a new direction for applying LLMs in the field of automatic control, offering greater deployability and practicality compared to vision-language models.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.RO\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 27 Jul 2025]\nTitle:ACCESS-AV: Adaptive Communication-Computation Codesign for Sustainable Autonomous Vehicle Localization in Smart Factories\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Autonomous Delivery Vehicles (ADVs) are increasingly used for transporting goods in 5G network-enabled smart factories, with the compute-intensive localization module presenting a significant opportunity for optimization. We propose ACCESS-AV, an energy-efficient Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) localization framework that leverages existing 5G infrastructure in smart factory environments. By opportunistically accessing the periodically broadcast 5G Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs) for localization, ACCESS-AV obviates the need for dedicated Roadside Units (RSUs) or additional onboard sensors to achieve energy efficiency as well as cost reduction. We implement an Angle-of-Arrival (AoA)-based estimation method using the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, optimized for resource-constrained ADV platforms through an adaptive communication-computation strategy that dynamically balances energy consumption with localization accuracy based on environmental conditions such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and vehicle velocity. Experimental results demonstrate that ACCESS-AV achieves an average energy reduction of 43.09% compared to non-adaptive systems employing AoA algorithms such as vanilla MUSIC, ESPRIT, and Root-MUSIC. It maintains sub-30 cm localization accuracy while also delivering substantial reductions in infrastructure and operational costs, establishing its viability for sustainable smart factory environments.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Rajat Bhattacharjya [view email][v1] Sun, 27 Jul 2025 19:44:07 UTC (7,225 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 27 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Relaxing Probabilistic Latent Variable Models' Specification via Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In this paper, we address the issue of model specification in probabilistic latent variable models (PLVMs) using an infinite-horizon optimal control approach. Traditional PLVMs rely on joint distributions to model complex data, but introducing latent variables results in an ill-posed parameter learning problem. To address this issue, regularization terms are typically introduced, leading to the development of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, where the latent variable distribution is restricted to a predefined normalized distribution family to facilitate the expectation step. To overcome this limitation, we propose representing the latent variable distribution as a finite set of instances perturbed via an ordinary differential equation with a control policy. This approach ensures that the instances asymptotically converge to the true latent variable distribution as time approaches infinity. By doing so, we reformulate the distribution inference problem as an optimal control policy determination problem, relaxing the model specification to an infinite-horizon path space. Building on this formulation, we derive the corresponding optimal control policy using the Pontryagin's maximum principle and provide a closed-form expression for its implementation using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. After that, we develop a novel, convergence-guaranteed EM algorithm for PLVMs based on this infinite-horizon-optimal-control-based inference strategy. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 27 Jul 2025]\nTitle:On Certificates for Almost Sure Reachability in Stochastic Systems\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Almost sure reachability refers to the property of a stochastic system whereby, from any initial condition, the system state reaches a given target set with probability one. In this paper, we study the problem of certifying almost sure reachability in discrete-time stochastic systems using drift and variant conditions. While these conditions are both necessary and sufficient in theory, computational approaches often rely on restricting the search to fixed templates, such as polynomial or quadratic functions. We show that this restriction compromises completeness: there exists a polynomial system for which a given target set is almost surely reachable but admits no polynomial certificate, and a linear system for which a neighborhood of the origin is almost surely reachable but admits no quadratic certificate. We then provide a complete characterization of reachability certificates for linear systems with additive noise. Our analysis yields conditions on the system matrices under which valid certificates exist, and shows how the structure and dimension of the system determine the need for non-quadratic templates. Our results generalize the classical random walk behavior to a broader class of stochastic dynamical systems.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Arash Bahari Kordabad [view email][v1] Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:24:27 UTC (85 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

A robust, finite-time, nonlinear feedback controller is introduced to reject bounded disturbances in tracking tasks. The proposed control framework differs conceptually from conventional controllers that utilize Euler angle parameterization for attitude and adhere to the traditional hierarchical inner-outer loop design. In standard approaches, the translational controller and the corresponding desired attitude are computed first, followed by the design of the attitude controller based on time-scale separation between fast attitude and slow translational dynamics. In contrast, the proposed control scheme is quaternion-based and utilizes a transit feed-forward term in the attitude dynamics that anticipates the slower translational subsystem. Robustness is achieved through the use of continuously differentiable sliding manifolds. The proposed approach guarantees semi-global finite-time stability, without requiring time-scale separation. Finally, numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

However, wireless network limitations create a critical bottleneck, struggling to meet the high-bandwidth and ultra-low latency demands essential for next-generation MIR experiences. This paper presents Hera, a modular framework for next-generation immersive applications, comprising a high-level streaming and synchronization layer for AR/VR systems and a low-level delay-based QoE-aware rate control protocol optimized for dynamic wireless environments. The Hera framework integrates application-aware streaming logic with a QoE-centric rate control core, enabling adaptive video quality, multi-user fairness, and low-latency communication across challenging 5G network conditions. We demonstrate that Hera outperforms existing state-of-the-art rate control algorithms by maintaining up to 66% lower latencies with comparable throughput performance, higher visual quality with 50% average bitrate improvements in our analysis, and improved fairness.

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 26 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Periodic orbit tracking in cislunar space: A finite-horizon approach\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper presents a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme for maintaining a spacecraft within a specified family of periodic orbits near the libration points in cislunar space. Unlike traditional approaches that track a predefined reference orbit, the proposed method designs an optimal trajectory that keeps the spacecraft within the orbit family, regardless of the initial reference. The Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) is used to model the system dynamics. First, the Pseudo-Arclength Continuation (PAC) method is employed to compute the members of each orbit family. Then, the state of each member is parameterized by two variables: one defining the orbit and the other specifying the location along it. These computed states are then fit to a Multivariate Polynomial Regression (MPR) model. An NMPC framework is developed to generate the optimal reference trajectory and compute the corresponding velocity impulses for trajectory tracking. The control system is integrated with a Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) observer that estimates the spacecraft's relative state. Numerical simulations are conducted for Lyapunov, halo, and near-rectilinear halo orbits near L1 and L2. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in fuel consumption compared to conventional tracking methods.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Mohammed Atallah [view email][v1] Sat, 26 Jul 2025 12:09:05 UTC (3,671 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Connections between DW shells and various graphical descriptions, as well as gain and phase measures, are established through an intuitive geometric perspective. Within this framework, we examine the relationships and relative conservatism among various separation conditions. A rotated Scaled Relative Graph (SRG) concept is proposed as a mixed gain-phase representation, from which a closed-loop stability criterion is derived and shown to be the least conservative among the existing 2-D graphical conditions for bi-component feedback loops.

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Robotics\n[Submitted on 26 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Homotopy-aware Multi-agent Navigation via Distributed Model Predictive Control\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Multi-agent trajectory planning requires ensuring both safety and efficiency, yet deadlocks remain a significant challenge, especially in obstacle-dense environments. Such deadlocks frequently occur when multiple agents attempt to traverse the same long and narrow corridor simultaneously. To address this, we propose a novel distributed trajectory planning framework that bridges the gap between global path and local trajectory cooperation. At the global level, a homotopy-aware optimal path planning algorithm is proposed, which fully leverages the topological structure of the environment. A reference path is chosen from distinct homotopy classes by considering both its spatial and temporal properties, leading to improved coordination among agents globally. At the local level, a model predictive control-based trajectory optimization method is used to generate dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories. Additionally, an online replanning strategy ensures its adaptability to dynamic environments. Simulations and experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating deadlocks. Ablation studies demonstrate that by incorporating time-aware homotopic properties into the underlying global paths, our method can significantly reduce deadlocks and improve the average success rate from 4%-13% to over 90% in randomly generated dense scenarios.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.RO\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The proposed LEM scheme utilizes a data-driven, model-free reinforcement learning approach based on the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enabling prosumers to make real-time decisions on whether to buy, sell, or refrain from any action while facilitating efficient coordination for optimal energy trading in a dynamic market. In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy using a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) model, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces financial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial pricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation capabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of different sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness improves through emergent cooperation among agents.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Charalambos Konstantinou [view email][v1] Sat, 26 Jul 2025 07:38:27 UTC (132 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 26 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Star Tracker Misalignment Compensation in Deep Space Navigation Through Model-Based Estimation\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This work presents a novel adaptive framework for simultaneously estimating spacecraft attitude and sensor misalignment. Uncorrected star tracker misalignment can introduce significant pointing errors that compromise mission objectives in GPS-denied environments. To address this challenge, the proposed architecture integrates a Bayesian Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) framework operating over an N x N x N 3D hypothesis grid. Each hypothesis employs a 9-state Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) to estimate attitude, angular velocity, and gyroscope bias using TRIAD-based vector measurements. A key contribution is the development of a robust grid refinement strategy that uses hypothesis diversity and weighted-mean grid centering to prevent the premature convergence commonly encountered in classical, dominant model-based refinement triggers. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the final misalignment RMSE relative to classical approaches, achieving arcsecond-level accuracy. The resulting framework offers a computationally tractable and statistically robust solution for in-flight calibration, enhancing the navigational autonomy of resource-constrained spacecraft.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Robotics\n[Submitted on 26 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Feeling the Force: A Nuanced Physics-based Traversability Sensor for Navigation in Unstructured Vegetation\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In many applications, robots are increasingly deployed in unstructured and natural environments where they encounter various types of vegetation. Vegetation presents unique challenges as a traversable obstacle, where the mechanical properties of the plants can influence whether a robot can safely collide with and overcome the obstacle. A more nuanced approach is required to assess the safety and traversability of these obstacles, as collisions can sometimes be safe and necessary for navigating through dense or unavoidable vegetation. This paper introduces a novel sensor designed to directly measure the applied forces exerted by vegetation on a robot: by directly capturing the push-back forces, our sensor provides a detailed understanding of the interactions between the robot and its surroundings. We demonstrate the sensor's effectiveness through experimental validations, showcasing its ability to measure subtle force variations. This force-based approach provides a quantifiable metric that can inform navigation decisions and serve as a foundation for developing future learning algorithms.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Muhammad Haseeb Zaar Khizar [view email][v1] Sat, 26 Jul 2025 07:01:48 UTC (3,019 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.RO\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

However, indoor environments such as long straight corridors can cause severe degeneracy problems in SLAM. In this paper, we use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train an adaptive degeneracy optimization agent (DOA) to address degeneracy problem. We propose a systematic methodology to address three critical challenges in traditional supervised learning frameworks: (1) data acquisition bottlenecks in degenerate dataset, (2) inherent quality deterioration of training samples, and (3) ambiguity in annotation protocol design. We design a specialized reward function to guide the agent in developing perception capabilities for degenerate environments. Using the output degeneracy factor as a reference weight, the agent can dynamically adjust the contribution of different sensors to pose optimization. Specifically, the observation distribution is shifted towards the motion model distribution, with the step size determined by a linear interpolation formula related to the degeneracy factor. In addition, we employ a transfer learning module to endow the agent with generalization capabilities across different environments and address the inefficiency of training in degenerate environments. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the rationality of our model design and the role of transfer learning. We also compare the proposed DOA with SOTA methods to prove its superior degeneracy detection and optimization capabilities across various environments.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.RO\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose a new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian visions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to satisfaction of both Wardrop's principles. Such cycles, represented as sequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and equalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers (like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows (like in System Optimum). We propose exact methods to compute such cycles and reduce their length and within-cycle inconvenience to the users. As identification of optimal cycles turns out to be NP-hard in many aspects, we introduce a greedy heuristic efficiently approximating the optimal solution. Finally, we introduce and discuss a new paradigm of Cyclical User Equilibrium, which ensures stability of optimal Wardropian Cycles under unilateral deviations.\nWe complement our theoretical study with large-scale simulations. In Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles with a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days. However, in Berlin, just five days of applying the greedy assignment rule significantly reduces initial inequity. In Barcelona, Anaheim, and Sioux Falls, less than 7% of the initial inequity remains after 10 days, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in improving traffic performance with more ubiquitous social acceptability.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Robotics\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\nTitle:RAKOMO: Reachability-Aware K-Order Markov Path Optimization for Quadrupedal Loco-Manipulation\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Legged manipulators, such as quadrupeds equipped with robotic arms, require motion planning techniques that account for their complex kinematic constraints in order to perform manipulation tasks both safely and effectively. However, trajectory optimization methods often face challenges due to the hybrid dynamics introduced by contact discontinuities, and tend to neglect leg limitations during planning for computational reasons. In this work, we propose RAKOMO, a path optimization technique that integrates the strengths of K-Order Markov Optimization (KOMO) with a kinematically-aware criterion based on the reachable region defined as reachability margin. We leverage a neural-network to predict the margin and optimize it by incorporating it in the standard KOMO formulation. This approach enables rapid convergence of gradient-based motion planning -- commonly tailored for continuous systems -- while adapting it effectively to legged manipulators, successfully executing loco-manipulation tasks.

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Robotics\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Reward-Augmented Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control in Precision Autonomous Parking via Policy Optimization Methods\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Autonomous parking (AP) represents a critical yet complex subset of intelligent vehicle automation, characterized by tight spatial constraints, frequent close-range obstacle interactions, and stringent safety margins. However, conventional rule-based and model-predictive methods often lack the adaptability and generalization needed to handle the nonlinear and environment-dependent complexities of AP. To address these limitations, we propose a reward-augmented learning framework for AP (RARLAP), that mitigates the inherent complexities of continuous-domain control by leveraging structured reward design to induce smooth and adaptable policy behavior, trained entirely within a high-fidelity Unity-based custom 3D simulation environment. We systematically design and assess three structured reward strategies: goal-only reward (GOR), dense proximity reward (DPR), and milestone-augmented reward (MAR), each integrated with both on-policy and off-policy optimization paradigms. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the on-policy MAR achieves a 91\\% success rate, yielding smoother trajectories and more robust behavior, while GOR and DPR fail to guide effective learning. Convergence and trajectory analyses demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances policy adaptability, accelerates training, and improves safety in continuous control. Overall, RARLAP establishes that reward augmentation effectively addresses complex autonomous parking challenges, enabling scalable and efficient policy optimization with both on- and off-policy methods. To support reproducibility, the code accompanying this paper is publicly available.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.RO\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Diversity and Interaction Quality of a Heterogeneous Multi-Agent System Applied to a Synchronization Problem\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In this paper, scalable controller design to achieve output synchronization for a heterogeneous discrete-time nonlinear multi-agent system is considered. The agents are assumed to exhibit potentially nonlinear dynamics but share linear common oscillatory modes. In a distributed control architecture, scalability is ensured by designing a small number of distinguished controllers, significantly fewer than the number of agents, even when agent diversity is high. Our findings indicate that the number of controllers required can be effectively determined by the number of strongly connected components of the underlying graph. The study in this paper builds on the recently developed phase theory of matrices and systems. First, we employ the concept of matrix phase, specifically the phase alignability of a collection of matrices, to quantify agent diversity. Next, we use matrix phase, particularly the essential phase of the graph Laplacian, to evaluate the interaction quality among the agents. Based on these insights, we derive a sufficient condition for the solvability of the synchronization problem, framed as a trade-off between the agent diversity and the interaction quality. In the process, a controller design procedure based on Lyapunov analysis is provided, which produces low gain, component-wise synchronizing controllers when the solvability condition is satisfied. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedure. Furthermore, we consider cases where the component-wise controller design problem is unsolvable. We propose alternative strategies involving the design of a small inventory of controllers, which can still achieve synchronization effectively by employing certain clustering methods to manage heterogeneity.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

State-of-the-art absolute control strategies are paired with a simple and effective relative control feedback law. Finally, a control barrier function is implemented to ensure recursively passively-safe bounded relative motion under feedback in the presence of possible missed maneuver events for the duration of the formation flight.

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Artificial Intelligence\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Multi-Year Asset Management Under Budget Constraints\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Amir Keshvari Fard [view email][v1] Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:42:34 UTC (6,660 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.AI\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The first uses a particle filter reweighted via magnetic similarity, employing a heavy-tailed non-Gaussian kernel for enhanced stability. The second is a stateless sequence alignment technique that transforms real-time magnetic signals into the spatial domain and matches them to the map using a similarity measure. Experiments with operational train data show that the particle filter achieves track-selective, sub-5-meter accuracy over 21.6 km, though its performance degrades at low speeds and during cold starts. Accuracy tests were constrained by the GNSS-based reference system. In contrast, the alignment-based method excels in cold-start scenarios, localizing within 30 m in 92 % of tests (100 % using top-3 matches). A hybrid approach combines both methods$\\unicode{x2014}$alignment-based initialization followed by particle filter tracking. Runtime analysis confirms real-time capability on consumer-grade hardware. The system delivers accurate, robust localization suitable for safety-critical rail applications.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SP\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Cell-based VSC Analysis Methodology: From Graph Laplacian to Converter Degrees of Freedom\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Power-electronics-based converters are being considerably employed through the power system to interconnect multiple heterogeneous electrical layers. Furthermore, the intrinsic versatility to play with the converter network topology is widely exploited to accommodate a certain number of terminals and ports according with the specific application. On this regard, several converter arrangements can be encountered in power applications. Moreover, to properly establish both the operation and the control, the so-called degrees of freedom (DOFs) need to be assessed per each converter topology. On this matter, similarly to the well-known Clarke transformation, which clearly reveals the DOFs for the star-based topology system, further similar transformations can be achieved to depict the independent set of variables characterizing a certain converter structure. Referring to the cell-based class of Voltage Source Converter (VSC) topologies, including Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC); this article proposes a general methodology to determine the change of variable matrix transformation for several converter arrangements which are related to complete bi-partite and multi-partite graphs. The methodology lies in the graph Laplacian spectral analysis, which remarks the structural normal modes at the converter points of connections. Furthermore, for a complete characterization, the instantaneous power patterns formulations, based on the DOFs, are also introduced.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Truncated Gaussian Noise Estimation in State-Space Models\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Within Bayesian state estimation, considerable effort has been devoted to incorporating constraints into state estimation for process optimization, state monitoring, fault detection and control. Nonetheless, in the domain of state-space system identification, the prevalent practice entails constructing models under Gaussian noise assumptions, which can lead to inaccuracies when the noise follows bounded distributions. With the aim of generalizing the Gaussian noise assumption to potentially truncated densities, this paper introduces a method for estimating the noise parameters in a state-space model subject to truncated Gaussian noise. Our proposed data-driven approach is rooted in maximum likelihood principles combined with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed approach is supported by a simulation example.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Rodrigo A.

We instantiate the framework with a convex relaxation of optimal control based on occupation measures, resulting in a convex optimization problem resembling the discrete shortest-paths linear program that can be solved efficiently to global optimality. While this approach inherits the limitations of semidefinite programming, scalability to large numbers of discrete modes improves compared to the NP-hard mixed-integer formulation. We use this to plan trajectories under temporal logic specifications, comparing the computed cost lower bound to a nonconvex optimization approach with fixed mode sequence. In our numerical experiments, we find that this bound is typically in the vicinity of the nonconvex solution, while the runtime speedup is significant compared to the often intractable mixed-integer formulation.

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Radio Map Assisted Routing and Predictive Resource Allocation over Dynamic Low Altitude Networks\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Dynamic low altitude networks offer significant potential for efficient and reliable data transport via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relays which usually operate with predetermined trajectories. However, it is challenging to optimize the data routing and resource allocation due to the time-varying topology and the need to control interference with terrestrial systems. Traditional schemes rely on time-expanded graphs with uniform and fine time subdivisions, making them impractical for interference-aware applications. This paper develops a dynamic space-time graph model with a cross-layer optimization framework that converts a joint routing and predictive resource allocation problem into a joint bottleneck path planning and resource allocation problem. We develop explicit deterministic bounds to handle the channel uncertainty and prove a monotonicity property in the problem structure that enables us to efficiently reach the globally optimal solution to the predictive resource allocation subproblem. Then, this approach is extended to multi-commodity transmission tasks through time-frequency allocation, and a bisection search algorithm is developed to find the optimum solution by leveraging the monotonicity of the feasible set family. Simulations verify that the single-commodity algorithm approaches global optimality with more than 30 dB performance gain over the classical graph-based methods for delay-sensitive and large data transportation. At the same time, the multi-commodity method achieves 100X improvements in dense service scenarios and enables an additional 20 dB performance gain by data segmenting.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

This work aims to develop an accurate localization system applicable to swarm robots equipped only with low-cost monocular vision sensors and visual markers. The system is designed to operate in fully open spaces, without landmarks or support from positioning infrastructures. To achieve this, we propose a localization method based on equilateral triangular formations. By leveraging the geometric properties of equilateral triangles, the accurate two-dimensional position of each participating robot is estimated using one-dimensional lateral distance information between robots, which can be reliably and accurately obtained with a low-cost monocular vision sensor. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that, as travel time increases, the positioning error of the proposed method becomes significantly smaller than that of a conventional dead-reckoning system, another low-cost localization approach applicable to open environments.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.RO\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

These capabilities make them ideal for missions requiring endurance and precision positioning. However, they also present significant control challenges: their large, lightweight structures are highly sensitive to environmental disturbances, and conventional aerodynamic control surfaces lose effectiveness during low-speed or hover flight. The objective of this thesis is to develop a robust control strategy tailored to a vectored-thrust airship equipped with tiltable propellers. The proposed approach is based on an Extended Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion inner loop in combination with a high level outer loop, controlling the attitude and velocity of the airship. The proposed method is able to effectively control the airship over the whole envelope, including hover and high speed flight. For this, effective use of available actuators is key. This includes especially the tilt rotors, for which a control allocation method is presented. The controller's performance is validated through a series of simulation-based test scenarios, including aggressive maneuvering, gust rejection, atmospheric turbulence, and significant parameter mismatches. The controller is compared against an alternative controller developed at the institute, offering insight into the trade-offs between direct inversion and incremental control approaches. Results demonstrate that the proposed E-INDI controller achieves very good tracking performance and high high robustness against parameter uncertainties.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Manuel Schimmer [view email][v1] Fri, 25 Jul 2025 08:19:13 UTC (18,526 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Existing literature explores both centralized and distributed approaches, while most work neglects temporal dynamics and the heterogeneity of the risk management of individual agents. To address this gap, this letter presents a heterogeneous risk management mechanism to incorporate uncertainties and risk attitudes into agent communication and decision-making strategy. Hence, this approach empowers enterprises to handle disruptions in stochastic environments in a distributed way, and in particular in the context of multi-agent control and management. Through a simulated case study, we showcase the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach under stochastic settings and how the decision of disruption responses changes when agents hold various risk attitudes.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.MA\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Multiagent Systems\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Dynamic distributed decision-making for resilient resource reallocation in disrupted manufacturing systems\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The COVID-19 pandemic brings many unexpected disruptions, such as frequently shifting markets and limited human workforce, to manufacturers. To stay competitive, flexible and real-time manufacturing decision-making strategies are needed to deal with such highly dynamic manufacturing environments. One essential problem is dynamic resource allocation to complete production tasks, especially when a resource disruption (e.g., machine breakdown) occurs. Though multi-agent methods have been proposed to solve the problem in a flexible and agile manner, the agent internal decision-making process and resource uncertainties have rarely been studied. This work introduces a model-based resource agent (RA) architecture that enables effective agent coordination and dynamic agent decision-making. Based on the RA architecture, a rescheduling strategy that incorporates risk assessment via a clustering agent coordination strategy is also proposed. A simulation-based case study is implemented to demonstrate dynamic rescheduling using the proposed multi-agent framework. The results show that the proposed method reduces the computational efforts while losing some throughput optimality compared to the centralized method. Furthermore, the case study illustrates that incorporating risk assessment into rescheduling decision-making improves the throughput.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.MA\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Multiagent Systems\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\nTitle:A Distributed Approach for Agile Supply Chain Decision-Making Based on Network Attributes\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In recent years, the frequent occurrence of disruptions has had a negative impact on global supply chains. To stay competitive, enterprises strive to remain agile through the implementation of efficient and effective decision-making strategies in reaction to disruptions. A significant effort has been made to develop these agile disruption mitigation approaches, leveraging both centralized and distributed decision-making strategies. Though trade-offs of centralized and distributed approaches have been analyzed in existing studies, no related work has been found on understanding supply chain performance based on the network attributes of the disrupted supply chain entities. In this paper, we characterize supply chains from a capability and network topological perspective and investigate the use of a distributed decision-making approach based on classical multi-agent frameworks. The performance of the distributed framework is evaluated through a comprehensive case study that investigates the performance of the supply chain as a function of the network structure and agent attributes within the network in the presence of a disruption. Comparison to a centralized decision-making approach highlights trade-offs between performance, computation time, and network communication based on the decision-making strategy and network architecture. Practitioners can use the outcomes of our studies to design response strategies based on agent capabilities, network attributes, and desired supply chain performance.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.MA\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Artificial Intelligence\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Large Language Model Powered Automated Modeling and Optimization of Active Distribution Network Dispatch Problems\nView PDFAbstract:The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative. However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval, optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively. Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent, greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and methods.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.AI\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The latter is often neglected, replaced with an upper bound or calculated as a numerical approximation of the spatial integrals involved. In this paper, we consider a special case of time-varying density functions modeled as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) that evolve with time via a set of time-varying sources (with known corresponding velocities). By imposing this structure, we obtain an efficient time-varying coverage controller that fully incorporates the time evolution of the density function. We show that the induced trajectories under our control law minimise the overall coverage cost. We elicit the structure of the proposed controller and compare it with a classical time-varying coverage controller, against which we benchmark the coverage performance in simulation. Furthermore, we highlight that the computationally efficient and distributed nature of the proposed control law makes it ideal for multi-vehicle robotic applications involving time-varying coverage control problems. We employ our method in plume monitoring using a swarm of drones. In an experimental field trial we show that drones guided by the proposed controller are able to track a simulated time-varying chemical plume in a distributed manner.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Enhancing Robustness of Control Barrier Function: A Reciprocal Resistance-based Approach\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In this note, a new reciprocal resistance-based control barrier function (RRCBF) is developed to enhance the robustness of control barrier functions for disturbed affine nonlinear systems, without requiring explicit knowledge of disturbance bounds. By integrating a reciprocal resistance-like term into the conventional zeroing barrier function framework, we formally establish the concept of the reciprocal resistance-based barrier function (RRBF), rigorously proving the forward invariance of its associated safe set and its robustness against bounded disturbances. The RRBF inherently generates a buffer zone near the boundary of the safe set, effectively dominating the influence of uncertainties and external disturbances. This foundational concept is extended to formulate RRCBFs, including their high-order variants. To alleviate conservatism in the presence of complex, time-varying disturbances, we further introduce a disturbance observer-based RRCBF (DO-RRCBF), which exploits disturbance estimates to enhance safety guarantees and recover nominal control performance. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through two simulation studies: a second-order linear system illustrating forward invariance in the phase plane, and an adaptive cruise control scenario demonstrating robustness in systems with high relative degree.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 25 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Approximating CCCV charging using SOC-dependent tapered charging power constraints in long-term microgrid planning\nView PDFAbstract:Traditional long-term microgrid planning models assume constant power charging for battery energy storage systems (BESS), overlooking efficiency losses that occur toward the end of charge due to rising internal resistance. While this issue can be mitigated at the cell level using constant current-constant voltage (CCCV) charging, it is impractical at the pack level in large-scale systems. However, battery management systems and inverter controls can emulate this effect by tapering charging power at high state-of-charge (SOC) levels, trading off charging speed for improved efficiency and reduced thermal stress. Ignoring this behavior in planning models can lead to undersized batteries and potential reliability issues. This paper proposes a tractable and scalable approach to approximate CCCV behavior using SOC-dependent tapered charging power (TCP) constraints. A MATLAB-based proof of concept demonstrates the energy delivery and efficiency benefits of tapering. The method is integrated into a long-term planning framework and evaluated under a synthetic load and solar profile. Results show tapering significantly affects BESS sizing, cost, and reliability under dynamic operating conditions that demand fast charging. These findings highlight tapering as a critical modeling factor for accurately capturing BESS performance in long-term microgrid planning.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Static optimization and cost-sharing methods often fail to adapt to evolving inequities, leading to participant dissatisfaction and unsustainable cooperation. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), cooperative game theory, and a dynamic equity-adjustment mechanism driven by reinforcement learning (RL). At its core, the framework utilizes a bi-level optimization model grounded in Equity-regarding Welfare Maximization (EqWM) principles, which incorporate Rawlsian fairness to prioritize the welfare of the least advantaged participants. We introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that dynamically adjusts socio-economic weights in the optimization objective based on observed inequities in cost and renewable energy access. This RL-powered feedback loop enables the system to learn and adapt, continuously striving for a more equitable state. To ensure transparency, Explainable AI (XAI) is used to interpret the benefit allocations derived from a weighted Shapley value. Validated across six realistic scenarios, the framework demonstrates peak demand reductions of up to 72.6%, and significant cooperative gains. The adaptive RL mechanism further reduces the Gini coefficient over time, showcasing a pathway to truly sustainable and fair energy communities.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Mathematics > Optimization and Control\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Multi-Year Maintenance Planning for Large-Scale Infrastructure Systems: A Novel Network Deep Q-Learning Approach\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Infrastructure asset management is essential for sustaining the performance of public infrastructure such as road networks, bridges, and utility networks. Traditional maintenance and rehabilitation planning methods often face scalability and computational challenges, particularly for large-scale networks with thousands of assets under budget constraints. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that optimizes asset management strategies for large infrastructure networks. By decomposing the network-level Markov Decision Process (MDP) into individual asset-level MDPs while using a unified neural network architecture, the proposed framework reduces computational complexity, improves learning efficiency, and enhances scalability. The framework directly incorporates annual budget constraints through a budget allocation mechanism, ensuring maintenance plans are both optimal and cost-effective. Through a case study on a large-scale pavement network of 68,800 segments, the proposed DRL framework demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods like Progressive Linear Programming and genetic algorithms, both in efficiency and network performance. This advancement contributes to infrastructure asset management and the broader application of reinforcement learning in complex, large-scale environments.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Amir Keshvari Fard [view email][v1] Thu, 24 Jul 2025 18:27:31 UTC (2,835 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\nmath.OC\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Design and optimization of a novel leaf-shape antenna for RF energy transfer\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In this research, the design and optimization of a novel leaf-shaped antenna inspired by natural leaf structures for radio frequency energy transfer is presented. The objectives of this study are to develop a bio-inspired antenna, optimize its performance through impedance matching for the 915 MHz frequency band, and evaluate its efficiency in capturing RF energy. The design process involves selecting an appropriate leaf shape, modeling the antenna using AutoCAD and HFSS software, and fabricating a printed circuit board (PCB) prototype. Simulations and physical tests are conducted to optimize the antennas performance, achieving an S11 parameter of nearly -20 dB at 915 MHz, indicating effective energy capture. Experimental results demonstrate the antennas ability to power a device at distances up to 200 cm, with charging times reflecting its efficiency. The study concludes that the bio-inspired design of the proposed antenna improves RF energy transfer. Future work should focus on testing the antennas penetration through concrete and developing a feedback system for autonomous alignment.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The system leverages the XIAO-nRF52840 Sense microcontroller and the LSM6DS3 IMU sensor to capture motion data, including acceleration and angular velocity, from four distinct activities: walking, stationary, going upstairs, and going downstairs. The data collected is processed through Edge Impulse, an edge AI platform, which enables the training of machine learning models that can be deployed directly onto the microcontroller for real-time activity this http URL data preprocessing step involves extracting relevant features from the raw sensor data using techniques such as sliding windows and data normalization, followed by training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier for activity recognition. The model achieves over 80% accuracy on a test dataset, demonstrating its ability to classify the four activities effectively. Additionally, the platform enables anomaly detection, further enhancing the robustness of the system. The integration of Tiny ML ensures low-power operation, making it suitable for battery-powered or energy-harvesting devices.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

This problem is equivalent to partial-state adaptive feedback, where the states modeling the dynamic uncertainty are unmeasured. We show that the DADS controller can bypass small-gain conditions and achieve robust regulation for systems in spite of the fact that the strength of the interconnections has no known bound. Moreover, no gain and state drift arise, regardless of the size of the disturbances and unknown parameters. Finally, the paper provides the detailed analysis of a control system where the unmeasured state (or the dynamic uncertainty) is infinite-dimensional and described by a reaction-diffusion Partial Differential Equation, where the diffusion coefficient and the reaction term are unknown. It is shown that even in the infinite-dimensional case, a DADS controller can be designed and guarantees robust regulation of the plant state.\nCurrent browse context:\nmath.OC\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Information Theory\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:On the Role of Age and Semantics of Information in Remote Estimation of Markov Sources\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper investigates the semantics-aware remote estimation of a finite-state Markov chain. We employ the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator and aim to devise a transmission policy to optimize estimation performance subject to a transmission frequency constraint. We leverage two metrics, namely the Age of Consecutive Error (AoCE) and the Age of Information (AoI), to quantify, respectively, the significance of estimation error at the transmitter and the predictability of outdated information at the receiver. The optimal transmission problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) with unbounded costs. We show the existence of an optimal simple mixture policy, which randomly selects between two deterministic switching policies with a fixed probability. Notably, each switching policy triggers a transmission only when the AoCE exceeds a threshold value that depends on both the AoI and the instantaneous estimation error. We further derive sufficient conditions under which the switching policy reduces to a simple threshold policy; that is, it admits identical thresholds for all estimation errors. Leveraging these results, we develop an efficient structure-aware algorithm, Insec-SPI, that computes the optimal policy with reduced computation overhead. Our results demonstrate that incorporating both AoI and AoCE yields significantly improved estimation quality compared to using either metric alone.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.IT\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Global Observer Design for a Class of Linear Observed Systems on Groups\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Linear observed systems on groups encode the geometry of a variety of practical state estimation problems. In this paper, we propose a unified observer framework for a class of linear observed systems by restricting a bi-invariant system on a Lie group to its normal subgroup. This structural property powerfully enables a system immersion of the original system into a linear time-varying system. Leveraging the immersion, an observer is constructed by first designing a Kalman-like observer for the immersed system and then reconstructing the group-valued state via optimization. Under a rank condition, global exponential stability (GES) is achieved provided one global optimum of the reconstruction optimization is found, reflecting the topological difficulties inherent to the non-Euclidean state space. Semi-global stability is guaranteed when input biases are jointly estimated. The theory is applied to the GES observer design for two-frame systems, capable of modeling a family of navigation problems. Two non-trivial examples are provided to illustrate implementation details.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:A Robust Predictive Control Method for Pump Scheduling in Water Distribution Networks\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Water utilities aim to reduce the high electrical costs of Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), primarily driven by pumping. However, pump scheduling is challenging due to model uncertainties and water demand forecast errors. This paper presents a Robust Model Predictive Control (RMPC) method for optimal and reliable pump scheduling, extending a previous efficient robust control method tailored to our model. A linear model with bounded additive disturbances is used to represent tank water level evolution, with uncertainty bounds derived from WDN simulation and demand data. At each time step, a pump scheduling policy, affine in past disturbances, is optimized to satisfy system constraints over a prediction horizon. The resulting policies are then applied in a receding horizon fashion. The optimization problem is formulated to require $\\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ computations per iteration with an interior-point method, which is reduced to $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ by reformulating it into a sparse form. When evaluated on a model representing the water distribution network of Randers, a medium-sized town in Denmark, the method surpasses nominal and constraint-tightening model predictive control (MPC) approaches in terms of meeting constraints and provides comparable economic outcomes.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Toward Sustainable Vertical Farming: Impacts of Environmental Factors and Energy Mix on Performance and Costs\nView PDFAbstract:The increasing interest in vertical farming arises from its ability to ensure consistent, high-quality, and pest-free vegetable production while supporting synergies with energy systems and urban development. Accordingly, standardized design and operation guidelines are essential to improve energy efficiency and lower costs. This study analyzes the production performance and energy consumption of a vertical farming system, assessing its efficiency, sustainability, and economic viability. A total of 162 scenarios were evaluated by combining three levels of temperature, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), and CO2 concentration across three distinct climatic zones, namely Norway, China, and Dubai, which also differ from a socio-environmental viewpoint. Two insulation thicknesses were also tested in each scenario. Results indicate that due to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and dehumidification (HVACD) system, neither the insulation layer nor the external climate significantly influences crop productivity. PPFD proved to be the dominant factor in crop growth (correlation: 0.85), followed by CO2 (0.36) and indoor temperature (0.22). PPFD also emerged as the primary driver of overall energy consumption (correlation: 0.73), as it affects both lighting and HVACD loads. Notably, the lowest specific energy consumption (SEC) coincided with the lowest crop productivity (55 kg/m2). The levelized cost of lettuce (LCoL), balancing productivity and energy use, identified the most cost-effective setup as 24C, 250 PPFD, 1400 ppm CO2, with insulation, consistent across all climates. Ultimately, only nearly decarbonized energy systems can support vertical farming without increasing CO2 emissions compared to imported lettuce.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Francesco Ceccanti [view email][v1] Thu, 24 Jul 2025 13:57:53 UTC (9,038 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Robotics\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control for Enhanced Vehicle Dynamics with Small On-Track Data Input\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In vehicle trajectory tracking tasks, the simplest approach is the Pure Pursuit (PP) Control. However, this single-point preview tracking strategy fails to consider vehicle model constraints, compromising driving safety. Model Predictive Control (MPC) as a widely adopted control method, optimizes control actions by incorporating mechanistic models and physical constraints. While its control performance critically depends on the accuracy of vehicle modeling. Traditional vehicle modeling approaches face inherent trade-offs between capturing nonlinear dynamics and maintaining computational efficiency, often resulting in reduced control performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Residual Koopman Model Predictive Control (RKMPC) framework. This method uses two linear MPC architecture to calculate control inputs: a Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) computes the baseline control input based on the vehicle kinematic model, and a neural network-based RKMPC calculates the compensation input. The final control command is obtained by adding these two components. This design preserves the reliability and interpretability of traditional mechanistic model while achieving performance optimization through residual modeling. This method has been validated on the Carsim-Matlab joint simulation platform and a physical 1:10 scale F1TENTH racing car. Experimental results show that RKMPC requires only 20% of the training data needed by traditional Koopman Model Predictive Control (KMPC) while delivering superior tracking performance. Compared to traditional LMPC, RKMPC reduces lateral error by 11.7%-22.1%, decreases heading error by 8.9%-15.8%, and improves front-wheel steering stability by up to 27.6%.

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Cryptography and Security\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Auto-SGCR: Automated Generation of Smart Grid Cyber Range Using IEC 61850 Standard Models\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Digitalization of power grids have made them increasingly susceptible to cyber-attacks in the past decade. Iterative cybersecurity testing is indispensable to counter emerging attack vectors and to ensure dependability of critical infrastructure. Furthermore, these can be used to evaluate cybersecurity configuration, effectiveness of the cybersecurity measures against various attack vectors, as well as to train smart grid cybersecurity experts defending the system. Enabling extensive experiments narrows the gap between academic research and production environment. A high-fidelity cyber range is vital as it is often infeasible to conduct such experiments and training using production environment. However, the design and implementation of cyber range requires extensive domain knowledge of physical and cyber aspect of the infrastructure. Furthermore, costs incurred for setup and maintenance of cyber range are significant. Moreover, most existing smart grid cyber ranges are designed as a one-off, proprietary system, and are limited in terms of configurability, accessibility, portability, and reproducibility. To address these challenges, an automated Smart grid Cyber Range generation framework is presented in this paper. Initially a human-/machine-friendly, XML-based modeling language called Smart Grid Modeling Language was defined, which incorporates IEC 61850 System Configuration Language files. Subsequently, a toolchain to parse SG-ML model files and automatically instantiate a functional smart grid cyber range was developed. The developed SG-ML models can be easily shared and/or modified to reproduce or customize for any cyber range.

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Optimal Integration Of Heat-Pump And Solar Thermal Energy In The Pre-heating Loop Of Wood And Gas Boiler Based District Heating System\nView PDFAbstract:The integration of renewable sources is essential for decarbonizing heat production in district energy networks. Beyond biomass-based solutions, solar thermal energy, with or without heat pumps, presents a significant opportunity. However, system performance is highly dependent on outdoor and setpoint temperatures. This study aims to optimize system design using a multi-criteria approach that considers techno-economic and environmental (CO2) factors. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed, incorporating temperature discretization for problem linearization and capturing key dynamic characteristics of heat generators. The model improves convergence, reducing a 19% MIP gap in 26 hours to 10% in 12 hours by dissipating 6% excess solar heat. A multi-scenario analysis under two carbon taxation levels and different CO2 emission cases revealed solar integration up to 11,932 m${}^2$ but increased gas reliance (50%) and TES losses (49%). Wood boiler inclusion reduced solar dependency, covering 45% of heat, lowered LCOH, but limited renewable penetration. Higher carbon taxes boosted solar adoption but faced storage inefficiencies, while biomass enhanced cost efficiency and system stability.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Eric Bideaux [view email] [via CCSD proxy][v1] Thu, 24 Jul 2025 08:59:36 UTC (855 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

In contrast to existing methods, where the provably stable controllers are restricted to be decentralized, we propose a unified design framework that enables the controllers to take advantage of an arbitrary communication infrastructure on top of the physical power network. This allows the controllers to incorporate information beyond their local bus, covering existing methods as a special case and leading to less conservative constraints on the controller design. We then provide a design procedure to construct input convex neural network (ICNN) based controllers that satisfy the identified stability constraints by design under arbitrary communication scenarios, and train these controllers using supervised learning. Simulation results on the the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) microgrid testbed illustrate the effectiveness of the framework and highlight the role of communication in improving control performance.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Unit Commitment Framework for Nuclear Reactors with Reactivity Decline",
    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Unit Commitment Framework for Nuclear Reactors with Reactivity Decline\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Nuclear reactors are often modeled as inflexible, baseload generators with fixed downtimes and restrictive ramping limits. In practice, however, a reactor's operational flexibility is closely tied to it's fuel cycle stage and the associated reactivity margin. A key physical constraint to power maneuverability is xenon poisoning, caused by an increase in neutron absorbing xenon concentration following a power ramp down. This can delay or even prevent subsequent power ramp up due to suppressed core reactivity. Additionally, if a reactor is shutdown during periods of low reactivity, restart times can vary significantly due to these xenon transients, leading to longer downtimes. This work introduces a physics informed, metaheuristic modeling approach that embeds fuel cycle dynamics directly with a unit commitment (UC) framework. The framework tracks reactivity margin, dynamically activates xenon related constraints, and endogenously implements refueling outages based on the core conditions. By capturing intra-cycle reactivity evolution and the conditional onset of xenon poisoning, the formulation allows for operation dependent nuclear dispatch that reflects both regulatory limits and physical behavior. When applied to a representative reactor fleet operating in distinct modes of operation -- ranging from baseload to part load -- the framework reveals that flexible operation can slow reactivity degradation and extend fuel cycles. The results show that fuel cycle aware flexibility modeling is critical for accurate scheduling of nuclear reactors and offers a tractable pathway to integrate nuclear power in energy system models.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Data-Driven Incremental GAS Certificate of Nonlinear Homogeneous Networks: A Formal Modular Approach\nView PDFAbstract:This work focuses on a compositional data-driven approach to verify incremental global asymptotic stability (delta-GAS) over interconnected homogeneous networks of degree one with unknown mathematical dynamics. Our proposed approach leverages the concept of incremental input-to-state stability (delta-ISS) of subsystems, characterized by delta-ISS Lyapunov functions. To implement our data-driven scheme, we initially reframe the delta-ISS Lyapunov conditions as a robust optimization program (ROP). However, due to the presence of unknown subsystem dynamics in the ROP constraints, we develop a scenario optimization program (SOP) by gathering data from trajectories of each unknown subsystem. We solve the SOP and construct a delta-ISS Lyapunov function for each subsystem with unknown dynamics. We then leverage a small-gain compositional condition to facilitate the construction of an incremental Lyapunov function for an unknown interconnected network with unknown dynamics based on its data-driven delta-ISS Lyapunov functions of individual subsystems, while providing correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that our data-driven compositional approach aligns sample complexity with subsystem granularity, resulting in a linear increase in required data as the number of subsystems rises. In contrast, the existing monolithic approach in the literature exhibits exponential growth in sample complexity with increasing number of subsystems, rendering it impractical for real-world applications. To validate the effectiveness of our compositional data-driven approach, we apply it to an unknown nonlinear homogeneous network of degree one, comprising 10000 subsystems. By gathering data from each unknown subsystem, we demonstrate that the interconnected network is delta-GAS with a correctness guarantee.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

V2G can increase grid reliability by providing distributed energy storage and ancillary services. However, on the other hand, it has a scope that encompasses the cyber-physical attack surface of the national power grid, introducing new vulnerabilities in monitoring and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. This paper investigates the maliciousness caused by Autonomous Vehicle to Grid (AV2G) communication infrastructures and assesses their impacts on SCADA system reliability. This paper presents a quantitative reliability assessment using Bayesian attack graph combined with probabilistic capacity outage modeling based on IEEE RTS-79 system data.

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Data-Driven Model Order Reduction for Continuous- and Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems\nView PDFAbstract:Model order reduction simplifies high-dimensional dynamical systems by deriving lower-dimensional models that preserve essential system characteristics. These techniques are crucial to controller design for complex systems while significantly reducing computational costs. Nevertheless, constructing effective reduced-order models (ROMs) poses considerable challenges, particularly for dynamical systems characterized by highly nonlinear terms. These challenges are further exacerbated when the actual system model is unavailable, a scenario frequently encountered in real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for the construction of ROMs for both continuous- and discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems with unknown mathematical models. By leveraging two sets of data collected from the system, referred to as two input-state trajectories, we first construct a data-based closed-loop representation of the system. We then establish a similarity relation between the output trajectories of the original system and those of its data-driven ROM employing the notion of simulation functions (SFs), thereby enabling a formal characterization of their closeness. To achieve this, we propose data-dependent semidefinite programs as sufficient conditions to simultaneously construct both ROMs and SFs, while offering correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that the obtained data-driven ROMs can be employed for synthesizing controllers that ensure the unknown system satisfies high-level logic properties. This is accomplished by first designing controllers for the data-driven ROMs and then translating the results back to the original system through an interface function. We evaluate the efficacy of our data-driven findings through four benchmark case studies involving unknown dynamics with highly nonlinear terms.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Two-Stage TSO-DSO Services Provision Framework for Electric Vehicle Coordination\nView PDFAbstract:High renewable penetration has been witnessed in power systems, resulting in reduced system inertia and increasing requirements for frequency response services. Electric vehicles (EVs), owing to their vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, can provide cost-effective frequency services for transmission system operators (TSOs). However, EVs that are inherently connected to distribution networks may pose voltage security issues for distribution system operators (DSOs) when supporting TSO frequency. To coordinate both TSO frequency and DSO voltage, this paper proposes a two-stage service provision framework for multi-EVs. At stage one, EVs participate in day-ahead TSO-DSO interactions for frequency reserve schedules; at stage two, EVs make real-time dispatching behaviors in distribution networks for reserve delivery while supporting DSO voltage. Considering the potentially large EV number and environment complexity, a decentralized operation paradigm is introduced for real-time EV dispatches at stage two, while a communication-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to reduce the communication overhead during large-scale multi-agent RL training without compromising policy performance. Case studies are carried out on a 6-bus transmission and 33-bus distribution network as well as a 69-bus distribution network to evaluate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method in enabling EVs for frequency service and voltage support.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Regional Frequency-Constrained Planning for the Optimal Sizing of Power Systems via Enhanced Input Convex Neural Networks\nView PDFAbstract:Large renewable penetration has been witnessed in power systems, resulting in reduced levels of system inertia and increasing requirements for frequency response services. There have been plenty of studies developing frequency-constrained models for power system security. However, most existing literature only considers uniform frequency security, while neglecting frequency spatial differences in different regions. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel planning model for the optimal sizing problem of power systems, capturing regional frequency security and inter-area frequency oscillations. Specifically, regional frequency constraints are first extracted via an enhanced input convex neural network (ICNN) and then embedded into the original optimisation for frequency security, where a principled weight initialisation strategy is adopted to deal with the gradient vanishing issues of non-negative weights in traditional ICNNs and enhance its fitting ability. An adaptive genetic algorithm with sparsity calculation and local search is developed to separate the planning model into two stages and effectively solve it iteratively. Case studies have been conducted on three different power systems to verify the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-constrained planning model in ensuring regional system security and obtaining realistic investment decisions.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Towards Microgrid Resilience Enhancement via Mobile Power Sources and Repair Crews: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach\nView PDFAbstract:Mobile power sources (MPSs) have been gradually deployed in microgrids as critical resources to coordinate with repair crews (RCs) towards resilience enhancement owing to their flexibility and mobility in handling the complex coupled power-transport systems. However, previous work solves the coordinated dispatch problem of MPSs and RCs in a centralized manner with the assumption that the communication network is still fully functioning after the event. However, there is growing evidence that certain extreme events will damage or degrade communication infrastructure, which makes centralized decision making impractical. To fill this gap, this paper formulates the resilience-driven dispatch problem of MPSs and RCs in a decentralized framework. To solve this problem, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning method featuring a two-level framework is proposed, where the high-level action is used to switch decision-making between power and transport networks, and the low-level action constructed via a hybrid policy is used to compute continuous scheduling and discrete routing decisions in power and transport networks, respectively. The proposed method also uses an embedded function encapsulating system dynamics to enhance learning stability and scalability. Case studies based on IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus power networks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in load restoration.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

While system operators and utility companies increasingly publicize system-level carbon emission information, it remains unclear how emissions from individual generators are transported through the grid and how they impact electricity users at specific locations. This paper presents a novel and computationally efficient approach for exact quantification of nodal average and marginal carbon emission rates, applicable to both AC and DC optimal power flow problems. The approach leverages graph-based topological sorting and directed cycle removal techniques, applied to directed graphs formed by generation dispatch and optimal power flow solutions. Our proposed algorithm efficiently identifies each generator's contribution to each node, capturing how emissions are spatially distributed under varying system conditions. To validate its effectiveness and reveal locational and temporal emission patterns in the real world, we simulate the 8,870-bus realistic California grid using actual CAISO data and the CATS model. Based on year long hourly data on nodal loads and renewable generation, obtained or estimated from CAISO public data, our method accurately estimates power flow conditions, generation mixes, and systemwide emissions, and delivers fine grained spatiotemporal emission analysis for every California county. Both our algorithm and the California study are open-sourced, providing a foundation for future research on grid emissions, planning, operations, and energy policy.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Robotics\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Modular Robot and Landmark Localisation Using Relative Bearing Measurements\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In this paper we propose a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach for systems composed of independent subsystems. The state and error covariance estimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative measurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in order to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates with each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least squares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the proposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem, noisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position measured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation problems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized simulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic joint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs. In this study we also include variants of the proposed method that achieve a graceful degradation of performance with reduced communication and bandwidth requirements.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.RO\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 24 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Simulation of Emergency Evacuation in Large Scale Metropolitan Railway Systems for Urban Resilience\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper presents a simulation for traffic evacuation during railway disruptions to enhance urban resilience. The research focuses on large-scale railway networks and provides flexible simulation settings to accommodate multiple node or line failures. The evacuation optimization model is mathematically formulated using matrix computation and nonlinear programming. The simulation integrates railway lines operated by various companies, along with external geographical features of the network. Furthermore, to address computational complexity in large-scale graph networks, a subgraph partitioning solution is employed for computation acceleration. The model is evaluated using the extensive railway network of Greater Tokyo. Data collection included both railway network structure and real-world GPS footfall data to estimate the number of station-area visitors for simulation input and evaluation purposes. Several evacuation scenarios were simulated for major stations including Tokyo, Shinjuku, Shibuya and so on. The results demonstrate that both evacuation passenger flow (EPF) and average travel time (ATT) during emergencies were successfully optimized, while remaining within the capacity constraints of neighboring stations and the targeted disruption recovery times.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

To address these issues, this paper investigates a sparse optimal control for infinite-dimensional linear systems and its application to networked systems where the network structure is represented by a limit function called a graphon that captures the overall connection pattern. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (i) To reduce computational complexity, we derive a sufficient condition under which the sparse optimal control can be obtained by solving its corresponding L1 optimization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a class of non-convex optimal control problems such that the optimal solution always coincides with a sparse optimal control, provided that the non-convex problems admit optimal solutions. (ii) We show that the sparse optimal control for large-scale finite-dimensional networked systems can be approximated by that of the corresponding limit graphon system, provided that the underlying graph is close to the limit graphon in the cut-norm topology. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through numerical examples.\nCurrent browse context:\nmath.OC\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The proposed system leverages DRL algorithms to dynamically manage the integration of renewable energy sources, energy storage, and grid power, adapting to fluctuating energy availability in real time. The study demonstrates that the DRL-optimized system achieves a 38\\% reduction in energy costs, significantly outperforming traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods (28\\%) and heuristic approaches (22\\%). Additionally, it maintains a low SLA violation rate of 1.5\\%, compared to 3.0\\% for RL and 4.8\\% for heuristic methods. The DRL-optimized approach also results in an 82\\% improvement in energy efficiency, surpassing other methods, and a 45\\% reduction in carbon emissions, making it the most environmentally friendly solution. The system's cumulative reward of 950 reflects its superior performance in balancing multiple objectives. Through rigorous testing and ablation studies, the paper validates the effectiveness of the DRL model's architecture and parameters, offering a robust solution for energy management in data centers. The findings highlight the potential of DRL in advancing energy optimization strategies and addressing sustainability challenges.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Researches revealed that system instability is led by the lacking of positive damping, yet it has not been clearly specified how much the exact amount of damping compensation required to sufficiently ensure system global stability. This paper presents a feasible solution for quantitative damping calculation and compensation to enhance the global stability of inverter-based systems. First, based on the system nodal admittance model, a quantitative damping calculation algorithm is presented, which can suggest the required damping compensation as well as compensation location for sufficient stability improvement. Then, we propose a specific AD with output current feedforward control strategy, which make the AD be quasi-pure resistive and can effectively enhance system damping efficiency. Finally, a testing system with three inverters is used as case study, showing that the proposed method provides a promising solution to efficiently enhance the global stability improvement of inverter-based systems. Simulations and experiments validate the proposed method.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The lack of information leads to less accurate designs of the systems, which are often difficult to resolve later. It is effective to use simulators to model the designed system and find out the issues early. However, the modeling time required by conventional simulators is too long to allow for rapid model creation to meet decision-making demands. In this paper, we propose a Rapid Modeling Architecture (RMA) for a lightweight industrial simulator that mitigates the modeling burden while maintaining the essential details in order to accelerate and improve decision-making. We have prototyped a simulator based on the RMA and applied it to the actual factory layout design problem. We also compared the modeling time of our simulator to that of an existing simulator, and as a result, our simulator achieved a 78.3% reduction in modeling time compared to conventional simulators.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Ad hoc networks of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) allow for real-time data sharing, but they face security challenges due to their decentralized nature, making them vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks. This paper introduces a trust-based framework for assured sensor fusion in distributed multi-agent networks, utilizing a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based approach to estimate the trustworthiness of agents and their provided information in a decentralized fashion. Trust-informed data fusion prioritizes fusing data from reliable sources, enhancing resilience and accuracy in contested environments. To evaluate the assured sensor fusion under attacks on system/mission sensing, we present a novel multi-agent aerial dataset built from the Unreal Engine simulator. We demonstrate through case studies improved ISR performance and an ability to detect malicious actors in adversarial settings.\nSubmission history\nFrom: R.

In this technical report, safety refers to ensuring that the robot respects state and input constraints while avoiding collisions with obstacles despite the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. This report offers a step-by-step approach to implementing Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) schemes addressing these safety requirements. Numerous books and survey papers provide comprehensive overviews of linear MPC (LMPC), NMPC, and their applications in various domains, including robotics. This report does not aim to replicate those exhaustive reviews. Instead, it focuses specifically on NMPC as a foundation for safe mobile robot navigation. The goal is to provide a practical and accessible path from theoretical concepts to mathematical proofs and implementation, emphasizing safety and performance guarantees. It is intended for researchers, robotics engineers, and practitioners seeking to bridge the gap between theoretical NMPC formulations and real-world robotic applications.\nThis report is not necessarily meant to remain fixed over time.

This enables the joint optimization of the barrier certificate and safe controller within a single formulation. The method accommodates stochastic dynamics with additive noise and a bounded continuous control set.

This setting is particularly relevant when there are limited observations (e.g., short trajectories) from individual data sources, making direct estimation challenging. In such cases, incorporating data from multiple related sources can improve learning. We propose an estimation algorithm that leverages different data requirements for the tasks of clustering and system identification. First, short impulse responses are estimated from individual trajectories and clustered. Then, refined models for each cluster are jointly estimated using multiple trajectories. We establish end-to-end finite sample guarantees for estimating Markov parameters and state space realizations and highlight trade-offs among the number of observed systems, the trajectory lengths, and the complexity of the underlying models.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

These data are typically gathered only from the system to be controlled. Nonetheless, the increasing connectivity and inherent similarity of (mass-produced) systems have the potential to generate a considerable amount of information that can be exploited to undertake a control task. In light of this, we propose a preliminary federated extension of DeePC that leverages a combination of input/output trajectories from multiple similar systems for predictive control. Supported by a suite of numerical examples, our analysis unveils the potential benefits of exploiting information from similar systems and its possible downsides.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 23 Jul 2025]\nTitle:A Joint Planning Model for Fixed and Mobile Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Considering Flexible Capacity Strategy\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has significantly increased demand on both transportation and power systems, posing challenges to their stable operation. To support the growing need for EV charging, both fixed charging stations (FCSs) and mobile charging stations (MCSs) have been introduced, serving as key interfaces between the power grid and traffic network. Recognizing the importance of collaborative planning across these sectors, this paper presents a two-stage joint planning model for FCSs and MCSs, utilizing an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The primary goal of the proposed model is to transform the potential negative impacts of large-scale EV integration into positive outcomes, thereby enhancing social welfare through collaboration among multiple stakeholders. In the first stage, we develop a framework for evaluating FCS locations, incorporating assessments of EV hosting capacity and voltage stability. The second stage introduces a joint planning model for FCSs and MCSs, aiming to minimize the overall social costs of the EV charging system while maintaining a reliable power supply. To solve the planning problem, we employ a combination of mixed-integer linear programming, queueing theory, and sequential quadratic programming. The improved ADMM algorithm couples the siting and sizing decisions consistently by introducing coupling constraints, and supports a distributed optimization framework that coordinates the interests of EV users, MCS operators, and distribution system operators. Additionally, a flexible capacity planning strategy that accounts for the multi-period development potential of EVCS is proposed to reduce both the complexity and the investment required for FCS construction. Finally, a case study with comparative experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed models and solution methods.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 23 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Model Predictive Control for Unlocking Energy Flexibility of Heat Pump and Thermal Energy Storage Systems: Experimental Results\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Increasing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) and electrification of energy systems necessitates the engagement of demand-side management (DSM) to help alleviate congestion in electricity grid. Heat pump and thermal energy storage (HPTES) systems, being energy efficient solutions, are becoming popular in modern buildings and are promising to contribute to demand-side management (DSM) due to their significant share in household electricity consumption. For typical HPTES systems, this paper presents a systematic design framework covering a control-oriented modeling process and energy-flexible model predictive control (MPC) design. The proposed MPC-based DSM strategy offers an innovative solution for efficient DSM by following a two-step DSM framework. In the first step, flexibility assessment is performed to quantitatively evaluate the flexibility potential of the HPTES system by solving a mixed-integer economic MPC problem. In the second step, flexibility exploitation is achieved through reacting to feasible demand response (DR) requests while respecting system constraints. Both numerical simulations and real-world experiments are performed based on a real HPTES installation to showcase the viability and effectiveness of the proposed design.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 23 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Integrating Physics-Based and Data-Driven Approaches for Probabilistic Building Energy Modeling\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Building energy modeling is a key tool for optimizing the performance of building energy systems. Historically, a wide spectrum of methods has been explored -- ranging from conventional physics-based models to purely data-driven techniques. Recently, hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both paradigms have gained attention. These include strategies such as learning surrogates for physics-based models, modeling residuals between simulated and observed data, fine-tuning surrogates with real-world measurements, using physics-based outputs as additional inputs for data-driven models, and integrating the physics-based output into the loss function the data-driven model. Despite this progress, two significant research gaps remain. First, most hybrid methods focus on deterministic modeling, often neglecting the inherent uncertainties caused by factors like weather fluctuations and occupant behavior. Second, there has been little systematic comparison within a probabilistic modeling framework. This study addresses these gaps by evaluating five representative hybrid approaches for probabilistic building energy modeling, focusing on quantile predictions of building thermodynamics in a real-world case study. Our results highlight two main findings. First, the performance of hybrid approaches varies across different building room types, but residual learning with a Feedforward Neural Network performs best on average. Notably, the residual approach is the only model that produces physically intuitive predictions when applied to out-of-distribution test data. Second, Quantile Conformal Prediction is an effective procedure for calibrating quantile predictions in case of indoor temperature modeling.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Leandro Von Krannichfeldt [view email][v1] Wed, 23 Jul 2025 14:07:33 UTC (3,419 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 23 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Output Feedback Design for Parameter Varying Systems subject to Persistent Disturbances and Control Rate Constraints\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper presents a technique for designing output feedback controllers for constrained linear parameter-varying systems that are subject to persistent disturbances. Specifically, we develop an incremental parameter-varying output feedback control law to address control rate constraints, as well as state and control amplitude constraints. The proposal is based on the concept of robust positively invariant sets and applies the extended Farkas' lemma to derive a set of algebraic conditions that define both the control gains and a robust positively invariant polyhedron that satisfies the control and state constraints. These algebraic conditions are formulated into a bilinear optimization problem aimed at determining the output feedback gains and the associated polyedral robust positively invariant region. The obtained controller ensures that any closed-loop trajectory originating from the polyhedron converges to another smaller inner polyhedral set around the origin in finite time, where the trajectory remains ultimately bounded regardless of the persistent disturbances and variations in system parameters. Furthermore, by including the sizes of the two polyhedral sets inside the objective function, the proposed optimization can also jointly enlarge the outer set while minimizing the inner one. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal in managing the specified constraints, disturbances, and parameter variations.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 23 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Optimizing Car Resequencing on Mixed-Model Assembly Lines: Algorithm Development and Deployment\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The mixed-model assembly line (MMAL) is a production system used in the automobile industry to manufacture different car models on the same conveyor, offering a high degree of product customization and flexibility. However, the MMAL also poses challenges, such as finding optimal sequences of models satisfying multiple constraints and objectives related to production performance, quality, and delivery -- including minimizing the number of color changeovers in the Paint Shop, balancing the workload and setup times on the assembly line, and meeting customer demand and delivery deadlines. We propose a multi-objective algorithm to solve the MMAL resequencing problem under consideration of all these aspects simultaneously. We also present empirical results obtained from recorded event data of the production process over $4$ weeks following the deployment of our algorithm in the Saarlouis plant of Ford-Werke GmbH. We achieved an improvement of the average batch size of about $30\\%$ over the old control software translating to a $23\\%$ reduction of color changeovers. Moreover, we reduced the spread of cars planned for a specific date by $10\\%$, reducing the risk of delays in delivery. We discuss effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm in improving production performance and quality as well as trade-offs and limitations.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Paolo Luigi Rinaldi [view email][v1] Wed, 23 Jul 2025 11:29:44 UTC (698 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Grid impedance plays a critical role in the operation and stability assessment of grid-connected inverter systems. This study presents a real-time grid impedance estimation method based on the Discrete Fourier Transform. The proposed method is integrated with the Advanced Angle Estimation Kalman Filter using a Linear Quadratic Regulator current controller (AAEKF-LQR), assisting the use of impedance information for accurate instantaneous phase angle estimation. Simulation results confirm that the proposed impedance estimation method interacts effectively with the AAEKF-LQR controller, maintaining stable system performance under weak grid conditions. The approach also demonstrates the ability to deliver fast and accurate impedance estimation during operational variations in grid conditions, thereby supporting stable inverter operation.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Phuoc Sang Nguyen [view email][v1] Wed, 23 Jul 2025 08:50:18 UTC (1,324 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 23 Jul 2025]\nTitle:On the Construction of Barrier Certificate: A Dynamic Programming Perspective\nView PDFAbstract:In this paper, we revisit the formal verification problem for stochastic dynamical systems over finite horizon using barrier certificates. Most existing work on this topic focuses on safety properties by constructing barrier certificates based on the notion of $c$-martingales. In this work, we first provide a new insight into the conditions of existing martingale-based barrier certificates from the perspective of dynamic programming operators. Specifically, we show that the existing conditions essentially provide a bound on the dynamic programming solution, which exactly characterizes the safety probability. Based on this new perspective, we demonstrate that the barrier conditions in existing approaches are unnecessarily conservative over unsafe states. To address this, we propose a new set of safety barrier certificate conditions that are strictly less conservative than existing ones, thereby providing tighter probability bounds for safety verification. We further extend our approach to the case of reach-avoid specifications by providing a set of new barrier certificate conditions. We also illustrate how to search for these new barrier certificates using sum-of-squares (SOS) programming. Finally, we use two numerical examples to demonstrate the advantages of our method compared to existing approaches.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

To deal with this, we propose a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates DC-OTS without relying on pre-solved labels. DA-DNN predicts line states and passes them through a differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible from the first iteration, which allows stable learning on large grids. Once trained, the proposed DA-DNN produces a provably feasible topology and dispatch pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer solvers become intractable. As a result, the proposed method successfully captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

To reach the breadth and depth of DE concept definitions, the interpretation of international standard sources is necessary, including ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, 24765, 42000-series, 15408, 15206, 27000-series, and 25000-series, to effectively model the knowledge domain where digital engineering applies. The harmonization of the concepts used in these international standards continues to improve with each revision, but it may be more effectively accomplished by relying on the descriptive logic formalized in the Web Ontology Language (OWL 2 DL). This paper presents a verified and consistent ontology based on the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies (CCO) that defines Seamless Digital Engineering as a digital tooling paradigm that relies on formal verification of digital interfaces to provide a system-level qualification of the assured integrity of a Digital Engineering Environment. The present work defines classes and equivalence axioms, while using only the BFO- and CCO-defined object properties that relate them, to provide a baseline analysis that may inform future DE-related ontology development, using a case study to formally define the `seamless' quality in relation to the updated ISO 25010 SQuaRE product quality model. We identified ISO meta-model inconsistencies that are resolvable using the BFO/CCO ontological framework, and define `seamless' as both a system integration quality and a Human-Computer Interface quality-in-use, working to disambiguate this concept in the context of DE.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 23 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Maintenance-free condition monitoring system based on lora\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:With the rising volume of railroad transportation, the traditional track inspection mainly relies on manual inspection and large-scale inspection equipment, which not only has low inspection frequency and lagging response, but also has the defects of high risk, high cost and easy to miss inspection. To this end, this study designs and realizes a maintenance-free railroad track wireless monitoring system based on LoRa module LM401. Each monitoring node consists of an STM32 microcontroller, an LM401 LoRa transceiver, a low-power ADXL362 triaxial acceleration sensor, a digital temperature sensor (LMT85), and a digital barometric pressure sensor (RSCM17100KP101). The system collects vibration data through the SPI1 interface at the node end, periodically reads the temperature and barometric pressure information, and packages and sends the data to a centralized gateway within a range of 500 m using the LoRa star topology; the gateway then uploads the data in real time to a cloud server through a 4G module, which supports the MQTT protocol. MQTT protocol is supported. Laboratory tests and field deployments show that the system can realize acceleration resolution of 0.01 g, reduce maintenance cost by about 70%, and improve monitoring efficiency by more than 5 times. The system provides a reliable means for intelligent rail health management, and in the future, it is planned to introduce RF energy collection technology to realize automatic wake-up without battery, and expand to urban bridges, tunnels and environmental monitoring and other multi-scenario applications.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 23 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Multi-Angle Rotational Actuation in a 0.8-mm-Thick Preload-Free Piezoelectric Micromotor\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Micro motors can be used in numerous fields like Micro medical testing and treatment. To achieve a smaller size, micro piezoelectric motors in laboratories often omit the outer casing, which can lead to functional defects such as rotation only in one fixed direction or the need for external weights (which are not counted within the motors volume) to increase preload. However, this significantly reduces the practical value of micro piezoelectric motors. This paper proposes a new driving principle for piezoelectric motors to design a micro piezoelectric motor that can rotate at a wide range of angles (e.g. up to 80)without increasing the motors casing and does not require external weights, with a stator thickness of only 0.8 mm. This motor has significant application potential in OCT endoscopes and thrombectomy grinding heads\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nChange to browse by:\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Signal Processing\n[Submitted on 23 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Design of a Noval Wearable ECG Monitoring Device\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The aim of this project is to develop a new wireless powered wearable ECG monitoring device. The main goal of the project is to provide a wireless, small-sized ECG monitoring device that can be worn for a long period of time by the monitored person. Electrocardiogram ECG reflects physiological and pathological information about heart activity and is commonly used to diagnose heart disease. Existing wearable smart ECG solutions suffer from high power consumption in both ECG diagnosis and transmission for high accuracy. Monitoring of ECG devices is mainly done by data extraction and acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, processing and analysis, visualisation and auxiliary procedures. During the pre-processing of the information, different kinds of noise generated during the signal collection need to be taken into account. The quality of the signal-to-noise ratio can usually be improved by optimising algorithms and reducing the noise power. The choice of electrodes usually has a direct impact on the signal-to-noise ratio and the user experience, and conventional Ag/AgCl gel electrodes are not suitable for long-term and dynamic monitoring as they are prone to skin irritation, inflammation and allergic reactions. Therefore, a completely new way of combining electrodes and wires will be used in the report. The electrodes and wires are cut in one piece from a silver-plated fabric. The wire portion is cut into a curved structure close to an S shape to ensure that it has good ductility for comfort and signal integrity during daily movement of the garment.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SP\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 23 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Transient Stability-Driven Planning for the Optimal Sizing of Resilient AC/DC Hybrid Microgrids\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper proposes a transient stability-driven planning framework for the optimal sizing problem of resilient AC/DC hybrid microgrids (HMGs) under different types of contingencies, capturing frequency and voltage stability requirements as well as the frequency-voltage coupling dynamics of AC/DC interlinking converters (ICs). The planning model is formulated into a defender-attacker-defender (DAD) architecture, which can be further merged into two levels, i.e., upper-level and low-level problems, and then iteratively solved by an enhanced genetic algorithm with sparsity calculation and local search. Regarding the operation stage, a novel transient stability-constrained optimal power flow (TSC-OPF) algorithm is proposed for static and transient operations of HMGs, capturing governor dynamics and automatic voltage regulator of conventional generators as well as the droop control dynamics of inverter-based resources (IBRs) for frequency control and voltage control, respectively. Furthermore, a Lyapunov optimisation approach is developed to capture the time-coupling property of energy storages (ESs) and then allow the TSC-OPF to be solved on an hourly basis with a second-scale resolution, achieving the co-optimisation of static and transient stability requirements. Case studies have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed planning framework in obtaining cost-effective investment decisions for various resources while respecting transient stability requirements under different contingencies.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

ZORMS-LfD enables the costs, constraints, and dynamics of constrained optimal control problems, in both continuous and discrete time, to be learned from expert demonstrations without requiring smoothness of the learning-loss landscape. In contrast, existing state-of-the-art first-order methods require the existence and computation of gradients of the costs, constraints, dynamics, and learning loss with respect to states, controls and/or parameters. Most existing methods are also tailored to discrete time, with constrained problems in continuous time receiving only cursory attention. We demonstrate that ZORMS-LfD matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods in terms of both learning loss and compute time across a variety of benchmark problems. On unconstrained continuous-time benchmark problems, ZORMS-LfD achieves similar loss performance to state-of-the-art first-order methods with an over $80$\\% reduction in compute time. On constrained continuous-time benchmark problems where there is no specialized state-of-the-art method, ZORMS-LfD is shown to outperform the commonly used gradient-free Nelder-Mead optimization method.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Previous studies using the UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset reported promising drift compensation results but lacked robust statistical experimental validation and may overcompensate for sensor drift, losing class-related this http URL address these limitations and improve sensor drift compensation with statistical rigor, we first designed two domain adaptation tasks based on the same electronic nose dataset: using the first batch to predict the remaining batches, simulating a controlled laboratory setting; and predicting the next batch using all prior batches, simulating continuous training data updates for online training. We then systematically tested three methods: our proposed novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) method, the benchmark method Domain Regularized Component Analysis (DRCA), and a hybrid method KD-DRCA, across 30 random test set partitions on the UCI dataset. We showed that KD consistently outperformed both DRCA and KD-DRCA, achieving up to an 18% improvement in accuracy and 15% in F1-score, demonstrating KD's superior effectiveness in drift compensation. This is the first application of KD for electronic nose drift mitigation, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art DRCA method and enhancing the reliability of sensor drift compensation in real-world environments.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

This is done by utilizing the optimal p-norm of the Generalized Mean Value or Power Mean (PM). Three well-established equations with verified accuracy are examined, namely Wheeler, Rosa, and the Monomial, which by definition consider only regular polygons. One critical parameter of the original equations is the outer-side length of the winding, which for the rectangle case, can be substituted by the PM of the two outer-side lengths, without the need for any further modifications. A methodology to select the optimal p-norm for the PM is presented in terms of achieving the best accuracy for this estimation. The selection of the optimal p is based on results from datasets containing more than 2600 simulations of different rectangle-shaped windings. Finally, the estimation accuracy is verified by laboratory measurements for a selection of planar inductors.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Theofilos Papadopoulos Christos [view email][v1] Tue, 22 Jul 2025 19:41:04 UTC (10,303 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Communication delay between the plant-level control and the inverter-level control in IBR plants has been recognized as one of the causes of such oscillations and a factor that impacts the system's stability. The control signals from the plant-level controller also experience sampling, with the sampled values held constant by the hold elements for the duration of the sampling period. This also has a bearing on the response of IBR plants. In this paper, we analyze the impacts of communication delay and sampling of control signals between plant-level control and inverter-level control of grid-following IBR plants on the small-signal stability of power systems. The underlying fundamentals of communication delay and sampling are revisited to explain the observed responses. Our findings emphasize the unique effects of communication delay and sampling period on the stability of IBR-rich power systems and suggest strategies to mitigate their detrimental impacts. The work also highlights the need for more accurate approaches for small-signal stability analysis of such systems.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 22 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Stable and Fair Benefit Allocation in Mixed-Energy Truck Platooning: A Coalitional Game Approach\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper addresses the benefit allocation in a mixed-energy truck platoon composed of fuel-powered and electric trucks. The interactions among trucks during platoon formation are modeled as a coalitional game with transferable utility. We first design a stable payoff allocation scheme that accounts for truck heterogeneity in energy savings and platoon roles (leader or follower), establishing core-stability conditions to ensure that no subset of trucks has an incentive to deviate for greater benefit. To enhance payoff fairness, we then propose a closed-form, Shapley value-based allocation approach that is computationally efficient and independent of the platoon size. Sufficient conditions under which the allocation is both fair and core-stable are provided. In scenarios where the Shapley value falls outside the core, we develop an alternative allocation based on the stable payoff that minimizes the mean relative deviation from the Shapley value while preserving core stability. This deviation is further proved to be upper-bounded by $1$, showing a favorable trade-off between stability and fairness. Finally, extensive numerical studies validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in facilitating stable, equitable, and sustainable cooperation in mixed-energy truck platooning.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 22 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Dynamic Activation and Assignment of SDN Controllers in LEO Satellite Constellations\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a promising approach for managing traditional satellite communication. This enhances opportunities for future services, including integrating satellite and terrestrial networks. In this paper, we have developed an SDN-enabled framework for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, incorporating the OpenFlow protocol, all within an OMNeT++ simulation environment. Dynamic controller assignment is one of the most significant challenges for large LEO constellations. Due to the movement of LEO satellites, satellite-controller assignments must be updated frequently to maintain low propagation delays. To address this issue, we present a dynamic satellite-to-controller assignment (DSCA) optimization problem that continuously adjusts these assignments. Our optimal DSCA (Opt-DSCA) approach minimizes propagation delay and optimizes the number of active controllers. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the DSCA approach significantly outperforms the static satellite-to-controller assignment (SSCA) approach. While SSCA may perform better with more controllers, this scheme fails to adapt to satellite movements. Our DSCA approach consistently improves network efficiency by dynamically reassigning satellites based on propagation delays. Further, we found diminishing returns when the number of controllers is increased beyond a certain point, suggesting optimal performance with a limited number of controllers. Opt-DSCA lowers propagation delays and improves network performance by optimizing satellite assignments and reducing active controllers.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The primary objective is to regulate the outlet temperature of one fluid stream by manipulating the flow rate of the second counter-current fluid stream. By leveraging the energy balance equations, we develop a structured bilinear system model derived by using a uniform spatial discretization of each stream into a cascade of homogeneous volumes and by considering the heat transfer and convective phenomena within the exchanger.

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 22 Jul 2025]\nTitle:A Distributed Actor-Critic Algorithm for Fixed-Time Consensus in Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based backstepping control strategy to achieve fixed time consensus in nonlinear multi-agent systems with strict feedback dynamics. Agents exchange only output information with their neighbors over a directed communication graph, without requiring full state measurements or symmetric communication. Achieving fixed time consensus, where convergence occurs within a pre-specified time bound that is independent of initial conditions is faced with significant challenges due to the presence of unknown nonlinearities, inter-agent couplings, and external disturbances. This work addresses these challenges by integrating actor critic reinforcement learning with a novel fixed time adaptation mechanism. Each agent employs an actor critic architecture supported by two estimator networks designed to handle system uncertainties and unknown perturbations. The adaptation laws are developed to ensure that all agents track the leader within a fixed time regardless of their initial conditions. The consensus and tracking errors are guaranteed to converge to a small neighborhood of the origin, with the convergence radius adjustable through control parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlight its advantages over state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence speed and robustness.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Maryam Babazadeh [view email][v1] Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:30:06 UTC (1,153 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 22 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Graphical Analysis of Nonlinear Multivariable Feedback Systems\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency-domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems. There have been recent efforts to generalize SRG analysis to Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. However, these attempts yielded only results for square systems, and in some cases, only methods applicable for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. In this paper, we develop a complete SRG framework for the analysis of MIMO systems, which may be nonlinear and non-square. The key element is the embedding of operators to a space of operators acting on a common Hilbert space, while restricting the input space to the original input dimension. We develop interconnection rules that use restricted input spaces and stability theorems to guarantee causality, well-posedness and (incremental) $L_2$-gain bounds for the overall interconnection. We show utilization of the proposed theoretical concepts on the analysis of nonlinear systems in a linear fractional representation form, which is a rather general class of systems with a representation form directly utilizable for control. Moreover, we provide formulas for the computation of MIMO SRGs of stable LTI operators and diagonal static nonlinear operators. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed approach on several examples.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Quantitative Biology > Neurons and Cognition\n[Submitted on 22 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Spiking neurons as predictive controllers of linear systems\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Neurons communicate with downstream systems via sparse and incredibly brief electrical pulses, or spikes. Using these events, they control various targets such as neuromuscular units, neurosecretory systems, and other neurons in connected circuits. This gave rise to the idea of spiking neurons as controllers, in which spikes are the control signal. Using instantaneous events directly as the control inputs, also called `impulse control', is challenging as it does not scale well to larger networks and has low analytical tractability. Therefore, current spiking control usually relies on filtering the spike signal to approximate analog control. This ultimately means spiking neural networks (SNNs) have to output a continuous control signal, necessitating continuous energy input into downstream systems. Here, we circumvent the need for rate-based representations, providing a scalable method for task-specific spiking control with sparse neural activity. In doing so, we take inspiration from both optimal control and neuroscience theory, and define a spiking rule where spikes are only emitted if they bring a dynamical system closer to a target. From this principle, we derive the required connectivity for an SNN, and show that it can successfully control linear systems. We show that for physically constrained systems, predictive control is required, and the control signal ends up exploiting the passive dynamics of the downstream system to reach a target. Finally, we show that the control method scales to both high-dimensional networks and systems. Importantly, in all cases, we maintain a closed-form mathematical derivation of the network connectivity, the network dynamics and the control objective. This work advances the understanding of SNNs as biologically-inspired controllers, providing insight into how real neurons could exert control, and enabling applications in neuromorphic hardware design.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Paolo Umberto Agliati [view email][v1] Tue, 22 Jul 2025 11:50:11 UTC (2,957 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\nq-bio.NC\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Robotics\n[Submitted on 22 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Guided Reinforcement Learning for Omnidirectional 3D Jumping in Quadruped Robots\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Jumping poses a significant challenge for quadruped robots, despite being crucial for many operational scenarios. While optimisation methods exist for controlling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive knowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in real-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable alternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of sample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and predictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the safety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages physical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining Bézier curves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing alternatives.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.RO\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Robotics\n[Submitted on 22 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Designing for Difference: How Human Characteristics Shape Perceptions of Collaborative Robots\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The development of assistive robots for social collaboration raises critical questions about responsible and inclusive design, especially when interacting with individuals from protected groups such as those with disabilities or advanced age. Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots. In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112 participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest, while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations. Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback, supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic systems tailored to diverse populations.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.RO\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 22 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Arbitrage Tactics in the Local Markets via Hierarchical Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Strategic bidding tactics employed by prosumers in local markets, including the Local Electricity Market (LEM) and Local Flexibility Market (LFM), have attracted significant attention due to their potential to enhance economic benefits for market participants through optimized energy management and bidding. While existing research has explored strategic bidding in a single market with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, arbitrage opportunities across local markets remain unexplored. This paper introduces a hierarchical MARL (HMARL) algorithm designed to enable aggregator arbitrage across multiple local markets. The strategic behavior of these aggregators in local markets is modeled as a two-stage Markov game: the first stage involves the LEM, while the second stage encompasses both the LFM and the balancing market. To solve this two-stage Markov game, the HMARL framework assigns two sub-agents to each aggregator, a primary sub-agent and a secondary sub-agent. Without the arbitrage strategy, these sub-agents operate in silos, with the primary sub-agent focusing on first-stage profits and the secondary sub-agent on second-stage profits, each employing independent MARLs. On the contrary, when implementing the arbitrage strategy with the proposed HMARL, the sub-agents communicate and coordinate to perform arbitrage across multiple local markets, enhancing overall efficiency. The case study, conducted under a scenario where all aggregators employ the arbitrage strategy, shows that despite higher initial costs in the LEM, this strategy generates substantial savings in the LFM and the balancing market, resulting in a total profit increase of $40.6\\%$ on average. This highlights the capability of the proposed HMARL to address the two-stage Markov game and facilitate arbitrage across local markets, thereby enhancing profitability for participants.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Robotics\n[Submitted on 22 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Distributed Oscillatory Guidance for Formation Flight of Fixed-Wing Drones\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The autonomous formation flight of fixed-wing drones is hard when the coordination requires the actuation over their speeds since they are critically bounded and aircraft are mostly designed to fly at a nominal airspeed. This paper proposes an algorithm to achieve formation flights of fixed-wing drones without requiring any actuation over their speed. In particular, we guide all the drones to travel over specific paths, e.g., parallel straight lines, and we superpose an oscillatory behavior onto the guiding vector field that drives the drones to the paths. This oscillation enables control over the average velocity along the path, thereby facilitating inter-drone coordination. Each drone adjusts its oscillation amplitude distributively in a closed-loop manner by communicating with neighboring agents in an undirected and connected graph. A novel consensus algorithm is introduced, leveraging a non-negative, asymmetric saturation function. This unconventional saturation is justified since negative amplitudes do not make drones travel backward or have a negative velocity along the path. Rigorous theoretical analysis of the algorithm is complemented by validation through numerical simulations and a real-world formation flight.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.RO\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

We present a derivative-agnostic approach, named Dainarx, to infer nonlinear hybrid systems where the dynamics are captured by nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) models. Dainarx employs NARX models as a unified, threshold-free representation through the detection of mode switching and trace-segment clustering. We show that Dainarx suffices to learn models that closely approximate a general class of hybrid systems featuring high-order nonlinear dynamics with exogenous inputs, nonlinear guard conditions, and linear resets. Experimental results on a collection of benchmarks indicate that our approach can effectively and efficiently infer nontrivial hybrid automata with high-order dynamics yielding significantly more accurate approximations than state-of-the-art techniques.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 22 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Polarforming Design for Movable Antenna Systems\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Polarforming has emerged as a promising technique to enable the antenna to shape its polarization into a desired state for aligning with that of the received electromagnetic (EM) wave or reconfiguring that of the transmitted EM wave. In this letter, we investigate polarforming design for the movable antenna (MA)-enabled communication system. Specifically, we consider a single-input single-output (SISO) system with reconfigurable antenna positions and polarizations to leverage both spatial and polarization degrees of freedom (DoFs). First, we present a polarized channel model and characterize the channel response as a function of antenna positions and polarforming phase shifts. To maximize the achievable rate of the proposed system, we then develop a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based optimization algorithm by iteratively optimizing the antenna positions and phase shifts at both the transmitter and receiver. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed system over conventional systems in mitigating channel depolarization and adapting to channel fading.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 22 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Comparing Behavioural Cloning and Reinforcement Learning for Spacecraft Guidance and Control Networks\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Guidance & control networks (G&CNETs) provide a promising alternative to on-board guidance and control (G&C) architectures for spacecraft, offering a differentiable, end-to-end representation of the guidance and control architecture. When training G&CNETs, two predominant paradigms emerge: behavioural cloning (BC), which mimics optimal trajectories, and reinforcement learning (RL), which learns optimal behaviour through trials and errors. Although both approaches have been adopted in G&CNET related literature, direct comparisons are notably absent. To address this, we conduct a systematic evaluation of BC and RL specifically for training G&CNETs on continuous-thrust spacecraft trajectory optimisation tasks. We introduce a novel RL training framework tailored to G&CNETs, incorporating decoupled action and control frequencies alongside reward redistribution strategies to stabilise training and to provide a fair comparison. Our results show that BC-trained G&CNETs excel at closely replicating expert policy behaviour, and thus the optimal control structure of a deterministic environment, but can be negatively constrained by the quality and coverage of the training dataset. In contrast RL-trained G&CNETs, beyond demonstrating a superior adaptability to stochastic conditions, can also discover solutions that improve upon suboptimal expert demonstrations, sometimes revealing globally optimal strategies that eluded the generation of training samples.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nChange to browse by:\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 22 Jul 2025]\nTitle:The Bode Plots for Sliding-Mode Control Design\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper develops a unified frequency-domain framework for the analysis of sliding-mode control systems, encompassing both discontinuous and Lipschitz-continuous implementations. Using describing function (DF) theory, closed-form expressions are derived for the amplitude and frequency of chattering oscillations, as well as equivalent gain (EG) models that enable closed-loop sensitivity analysis. The proposed methodology captures the influence of actuator dynamics, control parameters, and disturbance profiles on steady-state performance.\nTheoretical predictions for bias and oscillatory components are validated through simulations under both constant and sinusoidal perturbations. In the low-frequency regime, the EG-based sensitivity functions accurately predict the amplitude and phase of the system response, with tracking errors remaining within a 15\\% margin, provided that the DF assumptions hold. The framework also incorporates orbital stability considerations via Loebs criterion, ensuring that chattering remains bounded.\nOverall, the results offer practical insight into the robust design of sliding-mode controllers, enabling systematic gain tuning that balances disturbance rejection and chattering attenuation, while accounting for actuator and sensor constraints.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Ulises Arturo Pérez Ventura [view email][v1] Tue, 22 Jul 2025 06:52:26 UTC (5,730 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

In game theory, success of imitation has been characterized by unbeatability against other agents. Previous studies specified conditions under which imitation is unbeatable in repeated games, and clarified that the existence of unbeatable imitation is strongly related to the existence of payoff-controlling strategies, called zero-determinant strategies. However, the previous studies mainly focused on ``imitation of opponents''. It was pointed out that imitation of other players in the same group and imitation of other players in the same role in other groups generally result in different outcomes. Here, we investigate the existence condition of unbeatable imitation in the latter ``imitation of friends'' situations. We find that it is stronger than the existence condition of unbeatable zero-determinant strategies, whereas both are very limited. Our findings suggest a strong relation between them even in the `imitation of friends'' situations.\nCurrent browse context:\nphysics.soc-ph\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The research described in this paper investigated a shoe-worn energy harvesting system designed use the mechanical energy from walking to output electrical energy. A spring is attached to electromagnetic generator embedded in the heel of the shoe to recover the vertical pressure caused by the foot strike. The simulated prototype consisted of a standard EM generator designed in MATLAB demonstrating a maximum voltage of 12V. The initial low fidelity prototype demonstrated testing the relationship between the EM generator and a simple electrical circuit, with energy output observed.

However, its inherent high leakage currents, which lead to low piezoelectric response and poor temperature stability, have severely limited its practical applications. In this study, lead free piezoelectric ceramics of the 0.7BiFeO3-0.3BaTiO3 (BF-BT) system were prepared, and their microstructures along with high-temperature electrical performance were modulated by introducing Nd3+. The results indicate that moderate Nd doping improves lattice symmetry and reduces oxygen vacancy-related defect dipoles, thereby effectively suppressing leakage currents at temperatures above 75°C. The Nddoped samples exhibit significantly lower leakage current densities, reduced by over 99% compared to the undoped ceramics, reaching values as low as 10-5Acm-2. They also show higher resistivity under elevated temperatures and electric fields, offering notable improvements in thermal stability over the undoped counterparts. In addition, the Nd-doped samples achieved piezoelectric coefficients as high as 172 pC N -1 at room temperature while still maintaining high dielectric and piezoelectric responses at elevated temperatures. This work not only provides an effective way to solve the leakage current problem of BF-BT ceramics in high temperature applications but also indicates a new design strategy for optimizing the high temperature stability of lead free piezoelectric materials, which shows a broad application prospect in the field of high-temperature sensors and actuators.\nCurrent browse context:\ncond-mat.mtrl-sci\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

This study presents the development and validation of Filtered Modified MITRI (FMM), an enhanced risk index designed to improve the prioritization of high-criticality debris. Leveraging the MOCAT-MC simulation framework, we conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation and sensitivity analysis to probe the robustness of the FMM formulation. The results demonstrate that while the FMM provides superior identification of high-risk targets for annual removal campaigns, a nuanced performance trade-off exists between risk models depending on the operational removal cadence. The analysis also confirms that physically grounded mass terms are indispensable for practical risk assessment. By providing a validated open source tool and critical insights into the dynamics of risk, this research enhances our ability to select optimal ADR targets and ensure the long-term viability of LEO operations.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Yacob Biniam Medhin [view email][v1] Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:59:53 UTC (5,440 KB)\n[v2] Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:05:11 UTC (5,452 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nChange to browse by:\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 21 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Fast Feeder Reconfiguration via Mesh Adaptive Direct Search in Black-Box Distribution System Environments\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Feeder reconfiguration is a critical operational strategy in power distribution systems. However, existing optimization approaches typically rely on explicit mathematical formulations and analytical models, which are often infeasible in practical utility environments characterized by heterogeneous, proprietary, and black-box simulation modules. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fast feeder reconfiguration framework based on Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS). The proposed approach requires only performance metric evaluations through simulation modules used for power flow, protection, and voltage regulation analysis. A bi-objective formulation is adopted to jointly minimize active power loss and operational constraint violations. A Pareto-based frontier filter is integrated into the MADS algorithm to efficiently guide the search toward high-quality configurations while systematically pruning dominated solutions. The approach adaptively refines the search space around promising candidates using local polling strategies and convergence aware updates. Case studies on the IEEE-123 node test feeder demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal configurations with significantly fewer evaluations compared to heuristic methods.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The main problem is to overcome the uncertainty and nonlinearity of the system, due to different physiological parameters of the patient's body and maintain DOA of patients in desired range during surgery. This study demonstrates a fractional order fuzzy PID controller (FOFPID) and fractional order PID controller (FOPID) to the problem. The Whale Optimization Algorithms (WOA) is used to optimized the parameters of proposed controllers. The orders of derivative and integral fractional controller is achieved by WOA. The results indicate that FOFPID has a better performance than FOPID. To check the performance of the controllers in presence of uncertainty, physiological logical model of 8 patients has been investigated. The modeling is based on Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic model.

Here, we propose a bio-inspired leader-follower solution, which is aware of energy constraints of mobile agents and is apt to deal with large swarms. Akin to many natural systems, control objectives are formulated for the entire collective, and leaders and followers are allowed to plastically switch their role in time. We frame a density control problem, modeling the agents' population via a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. This approach allows for a compact description that inherently avoids the curse of dimensionality and improves analytical tractability. We derive analytical guarantees for the existence of desired steady-state solutions and their local stability for one-dimensional and higher-dimensional problems. We numerically validate our control methodology, offering support to the effectiveness, robustness, and versatility of our proposed bio-inspired control strategy.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Gian Carlo Maffettone [view email][v1] Mon, 21 Jul 2025 16:36:15 UTC (714 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Machine Learning\n[Submitted on 21 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Optimal Batch-Size Control for Low-Latency Federated Learning with Device Heterogeneity\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular approach for collaborative machine learning in sixth-generation (6G) networks, primarily due to its privacy-preserving capabilities. The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to empower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous driving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of low-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In practice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of computing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the heterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across devices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework for optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency while ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental C$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically, increasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and thus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but results in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of latency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an accurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted to real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored to scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device heterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that do not consider the C$^2$ tradeoff or device heterogeneity.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The result is a theorem that can be used to assess stability and $L_2$-gain performance for general interconnections of nonlinear dynamic systems. We provide practical calculation results for canonical interconnections and apply our result to Lur'e systems to obtain a generalization of the celebrated circle criterion, which deals with broader class of nonlinearities, and we derive (incremental) $L_2$-gain performance bounds.

    "abstract": "Mathematics > Optimization and Control\n[Submitted on 21 Jul 2025 (v1), last revised 23 Jul 2025 (this version, v2)]\nTitle:Constrained Control Allocation With Continuous-Time Rate Constraints: Three-Dimensional Case\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper presents a novel quadratic programming (QP) approach for constrained control allocation that directly incorporates continuous-time actuator rate constraints without requiring slack variables. Over-actuated aircraft configurations, particularly prevalent in eVTOL and military applications, require control allocation algorithms to distribute commanded control moments among available actuators while respecting position and rate constraints. Existing methods such as direct allocation, pseudo-inverse, cascaded generalized inverse, and exact redistributed pseudo-inverse either cannot handle rate constraints in continuous time or require discretization approaches that compromise performance. Current QP methods that incorporate rate constraints rely on slack variables to ensure feasibility, which prevents full utilization of the attainable moment set and degrades allocation performance. The proposed methodology addresses this limitation by calculating the attainable moment set from both position and rate constraints through convex hull operations, then ensuring feasibility by scaling unattainable commanded moments to the boundary of the attainable moment set while preserving their direction. This approach guarantees the feasibility of the optimization problem without slack variables. The method is validated through simulation on an F-18 fighter aircraft control allocation problem, demonstrating equivalent performance to the established exact redistributed pseudo-inverse method while providing smoother actuator behavior and enhanced constraint satisfaction. Results show that incorporating continuous-time rate constraints leads to improved actuator tracking, reduced overshoot, and more precise adherence to position limits, which is essential for aircraft safety, ride comfort, and actuator longevity.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Süleyman Özkurt [view email][v1] Mon, 21 Jul 2025 10:45:44 UTC (872 KB)\n[v2] Wed, 23 Jul 2025 07:41:29 UTC (872 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\nmath.OC\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 21 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Transformer-based Deep Learning Model for Joint Routing and Scheduling with Varying Electric Vehicle Numbers\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The growing integration of renewable energy sources in modern power systems has introduced significant operational challenges due to their intermittent and uncertain outputs. In recent years, mobile energy storage systems (ESSs) have emerged as a popular flexible resource for mitigating these challenges. Compared to stationary ESSs, mobile ESSs offer additional spatial flexibility, enabling cost-effective energy delivery through the transportation network. However, the widespread deployment of mobile ESSs is often hindered by the high investment cost, which has motivated researchers to investigate utilising more readily available alternatives, such as electric vehicles (EVs) as mobile energy storage units instead. Hence, we explore this opportunity with a MIP-based day-ahead electric vehicle joint routing and scheduling problem in this work. However, solving the problem in a practical setting can often be computationally intractable since the existence of binary variables makes it combinatorial challenging. Therefore, we proposed to simplify the problem's solution process for a MIP solver by pruning the solution search space with a transformer-based deep learning (DL) model. This is done by training the model to rapidly predict the optimal binary solutions. In addition, unlike many existing DL approaches that assume fixed problem structures, the proposed model is designed to accommodate problems with EV fleets of any sizes. This flexibility is essential since frequent re-training can introduce significant computational overhead. We evaluated the approach with simulations on the IEEE 33-bus system coupled with the Nguyen-Dupuis transportation network.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Part II revisits the effect of GFLs on frequency spatial variation. Leveraging the interfacing state variables and equivalent frequency defined in Part I, an extended frequency divider (FD) formula is proposed. The linearized mapping relationship between network node frequency and synchronous generator (SG) rotor frequency, as well as GFL equivalent frequency, is modeled. The superposition contribution from GFLs is determined by the electrical distance between the generator and the frequency observation node, as well as the system power flow conditions. Additionally, the frequency mapping for branch currents, which is overlooked in previous research, is addressed. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed extended FD formula. They quantitatively demonstrate that the superposition contribution of GFLs to node frequency is relatively weak and that the superposition coefficient is time-varying. The branch frequency superposition reveals a complex and distinctly different pattern.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Part I of this series clarifies the mechanisms by which GFLs influence COI frequency dynamics. A multi-generator model of the power system with GFLs is developed, incorporating the local dynamics of GFLs and their interaction with synchronous generators via virtual tie lines. By aggregating the multi-generator model into the COI frame, the interaction between the COI frequency and the equivalent frequency of GFLs is revealed. The equivalent inertia and other components at the GFL side, determined by control parameters and operating conditions, support the COI through virtual tying power. Simulation validates the accuracy of the proposed modeling and demonstrates that the impact of GFLs on COI frequency is relatively weak. The equivalent inertia and other components of GFLs still significantly influence COI frequency dynamics, with their effects being both time-variable and adjustable.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 21 Jul 2025]\nTitle:RoCoF Constrained Regional Inertia Security Region: Formulation and Application\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The regional inertia, which determines the regional rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), should be kept in a secure status in renewable-penetrated power systems. To break away from mapping the regional maximum RoCoF with regional inertia in a linearized form, this paper comprehensively studies the regional inertia security problem from formulation to applications. Firstly, the regional inertia security region (R-ISR) is defined, whose boundary is non-linear and non-convex. Then, a local linearized method is devised to calculate the global maximum of regional RoCoF. The non-convex ISR boundary is expressed by multiple simple boundaries corresponding to each local solution, which can be obtained by a simple search-based method. Finally, the convexified R-ISR constraint is formed by convex decomposition and embedded in an inertia optimal adjustment model. The results on a 3-region system show some counter-intuitive findings, such as increasing the inertia of one region may worsen its RoCoF.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 21 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Joint Optimisation of Electric Vehicle Routing and Scheduling: A Deep Learning-Driven Approach for Dynamic Fleet Sizes\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Electric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly prevalent nowadays, with studies highlighting their potential as mobile energy storage systems to provide grid support. Realising this potential requires effective charging coordination, which are often formulated as mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems. However, MIP problems are NP-hard and often intractable when applied to time-sensitive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a deep learning assisted approach for optimising a day-ahead EV joint routing and scheduling problem with varying number of EVs. This problem simultaneously optimises EV routing, charging, discharging and generator scheduling within a distribution network with renewable energy sources. A convolutional neural network is trained to predict the binary variables, thereby reducing the solution search space and enabling solvers to determine the remaining variables more efficiently. Additionally, a padding mechanism is included to handle the changes in input and output sizes caused by varying number of EVs, thus eliminating the need for re-training. In a case study on the IEEE 33-bus system and Nguyen-Dupuis transportation network, our approach reduced runtime by 97.8% when compared to an unassisted MIP solver, while retaining 99.5% feasibility and deviating less than 0.01% from the optimal solution.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Mathematics > Optimization and Control\n[Submitted on 21 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Event-Triggered Resilient Consensus of Networked Euler-Lagrange Systems Under Byzantine Attacks\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The resilient consensus problem is investigated in this paper for a class of networked Euler-Lagrange systems with event-triggered communication in the presence of Byzantine attacks. One challenge that we face in addressing the considered problem is the inapplicability of existing resilient decision algorithms designed for one-dimensional multi-agent systems. This is because the networked Euler-Lagrange systems fall into the category of multi-dimensional multi-agent systems with coupling among state vector components. To address this problem, we propose a new resilient decision algorithm. This algorithm constructs auxiliary variables related to the coordinative objectives for each normal agent, and transforms the considered resilient consensus problem into the consensus problem of the designed auxiliary variables. Furthermore, to relax the constraints imposed on Byzantine agent behavior patterns within continuous-time scenarios, the event-triggered communication scheme is adopted. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through case studies.\nCurrent browse context:\nmath.OC\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Robotics\n[Submitted on 21 Jul 2025]\nTitle:VLM-UDMC: VLM-Enhanced Unified Decision-Making and Motion Control for Urban Autonomous Driving\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Scene understanding and risk-aware attentions are crucial for human drivers to make safe and effective driving decisions. To imitate this cognitive ability in urban autonomous driving while ensuring the transparency and interpretability, we propose a vision-language model (VLM)-enhanced unified decision-making and motion control framework, named VLM-UDMC. This framework incorporates scene reasoning and risk-aware insights into an upper-level slow system, which dynamically reconfigures the optimal motion planning for the downstream fast system. The reconfiguration is based on real-time environmental changes, which are encoded through context-aware potential functions. More specifically, the upper-level slow system employs a two-step reasoning policy with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), leveraging foundation models to process multimodal inputs and retrieve contextual knowledge, thereby generating risk-aware insights. Meanwhile, a lightweight multi-kernel decomposed LSTM provides real-time trajectory predictions for heterogeneous traffic participants by extracting smoother trend representations for short-horizon trajectory prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed VLM-UDMC framework is verified via both simulations and real-world experiments with a full-size autonomous vehicle. It is demonstrated that the presented VLM-UDMC effectively leverages scene understanding and attention decomposition for rational driving decisions, thus improving the overall urban driving performance.

The applicability of integrated Building Information Modeling (BIM) and solarpowered environmental monitoring systems for energy optimization in low-carbon smart buildings remains underexplored. Can BIM-driven design improvements, combined with photovoltaic systems, achieve substantial energy savings while enabling self-powered environmental monitoring? This study conducts a case analysis on a retrofitted primary school building in Guangdong, China, utilizing BIM-based energy simulations, material optimization, and solar technology integration. The outcomes reveal that the proposed approach reduced annual energy consumption by 40.68%, with lighting energy use decreasing by 36.59%. A rooftop photovoltaic system demonstrated a payback period of 7.46 years while powering environmental sensors autonomously. Hardware system integrates sensors and an ARDUINO-based controller to detect environmental factors like rainfall, temperature, and air quality. It is powered by a 6W solar panel and a 2200 mAh/7.4 V lithium battery to ensure stable operation. This study underscores the potential of BIM and solar energy integration to transform traditional buildings into energy-efficient, self-sustaining smart structures.

These updates include adjustments to incident response procedures and modifications to access controls, among others. Reinforcement learning methods have been proposed for automating such policy adaptations, but most of the methods in the research literature lack performance guarantees and adapt slowly to changes. In this paper, we address these limitations and present a method for computing security policies that is scalable, offers theoretical guarantees, and adapts quickly to changes. It assumes a model or simulator of the system and comprises three components: belief estimation through particle filtering, offline policy computation through aggregation, and online policy adaptation through rollout. Central to our method is a new feature-based aggregation technique, which improves scalability and flexibility. We analyze the approximation error of aggregation and show that rollout efficiently adapts policies to changes under certain conditions. Simulations and testbed results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, including CAGE-2.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

A fundamental challenge in feedback optimization is the requirement of accurate first-order information\nof the steady-state input-output mapping, which is computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional nonlinear systems and\noften leads to poor performance when approximated around a fixed operating point. To address this limitation, we propose a\nsequential algorithm that adaptively updates the linearization point during optimization, maintaining local accuracy throughout\nthe trajectory. We prove convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal steady state with explicit error bounds. To reduce the\ncomputational burden of repeated linearization operations, we further develop a multi-timescale variant where linearization\nupdates occur at a slower timescale than optimization iterations, achieving significant computational savings while preserving\nconvergence guarantees. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated via numerical simulations of a realistic\nwind farm control problem.

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 20 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Exact Finite Koopman Embedding of Block-Oriented Polynomial Systems\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The challenge of finding exact and finite-dimensional Koopman embeddings of nonlinear systems has been largely circumvented by employing data-driven techniques to learn models of different complexities (e.g., linear, bilinear, input affine). Although these models may provide good accuracy, selecting the model structure and dimension is still ad-hoc and it is difficult to quantify the error that is introduced. In contrast to the general trend of data-driven learning, in this paper, we develop a systematic technique for nonlinear systems that produces a finite-dimensional and exact embedding. If the nonlinear system is represented as a network of series and parallel linear and nonlinear (polynomial) blocks, one can derive an associated Koopman model that has constant state and output matrices and the input influence is polynomial. Furthermore, if the linear blocks do not have feedthrough, the Koopman representation simplifies to a bilinear model.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Lucian Cristian Iacob [view email][v1] Sun, 20 Jul 2025 19:18:17 UTC (890 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Lyapunov stability is characterized as the property of inversely mapping filters to filters, Lagrange stability as that of mapping ideals to ideals. These abstract definitions unveil a deep duality between the two stability notions, enable a definition of global stability for abstract systems, and yield an agile generalization of the stability theorems for basic series, parallel, and feedback interconnections, including a small-gain theorem. Moreover, it is shown that Lagrange stability is abstractly identical to other properties of interest in control theory, such as safety and positivity, whose preservation under interconnections can be thus studied owing to the developed stability results.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 20 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Safety Controller Synthesis for Stochastic Networked Systems under Communication Constraints\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper develops a framework for synthesizing safety controllers for discrete-time stochastic linear control systems (dt-SLS) operating under communication imperfections. The control unit is remote and communicates with the sensor and actuator through an imperfect wireless network. We consider a constant delay in the sensor-to-controller channel (uplink), and data loss in both sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator (downlink) channels. In our proposed scheme, data loss in each channel is modeled as an independent Bernoulli-distributed random process. To systematically handle the uplink delay, we first introduce an augmented discrete-time stochastic linear system (dt-ASLS) by concatenating all states and control inputs that sufficiently represent the state-input evolution of the original dt-SLS under the delay and packet loss constraints. We then leverage control barrier certificates (CBCs) for dt-ASLS to synthesize a controller that guarantees dt-SLS safety in a stochastic sense, ensuring that all trajectories of dt-SLS remain within safe regions with a quantified probabilistic bound. Our approach translates safety constraints into matrix inequalities, leading to an optimization problem that eventually quantifies the probability of satisfying the safety specification in the presence of communication imperfections. We validate our results on an RLC circuit subject to both constant delay and probabilistic data loss.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

However, a critical challenge remains: verifying that the learned CBFs truly enforce safety across the entire state space. This is especially difficult when CBF is represented using neural networks (NCBFs). Several existing verification techniques attempt to address this problem including SMT-based solvers, mixed-integer programming (MIP), and interval or bound-propagation methods but these approaches often introduce loose, conservative bounds. To overcome these limitations, in this work we use CPED-NCBFs a split-conformal prediction based verification strategy to verify the learned NCBF from the expert demonstrations. We further validate our method on point mass systems and unicycle models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theory.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.RO\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Machine Learning\n[Submitted on 20 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Clustered Federated Learning for Generalizable FDIA Detection in Smart Grids with Heterogeneous Data\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose severe security risks to smart grids by manipulating measurement data collected from spatially distributed devices such as SCADA systems and PMUs. These measurements typically exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics across different regions, which significantly challenges the generalization ability of detection models. Traditional centralized training approaches not only face privacy risks and data sharing constraints but also incur high transmission costs, limiting their scalability and deployment feasibility. To address these issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed Federated Cluster Average (FedClusAvg), designed to improve FDIA detection in Non-IID and resource-constrained environments. FedClusAvg incorporates cluster-based stratified sampling and hierarchical communication (client-subserver-server) to enhance model generalization and reduce communication overhead. By enabling localized training and weighted parameter aggregation, the algorithm achieves accurate model convergence without centralizing sensitive data. Experimental results on benchmark smart grid datasets demonstrate that FedClusAvg not only improves detection accuracy under heterogeneous data distributions but also significantly reduces communication rounds and bandwidth consumption. This work provides an effective solution for secure and efficient FDIA detection in large-scale distributed power systems.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.LG\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\nIArxiv Recommender\n(What is IArxiv?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The approach is based on the utilisation of weighting augmentation for incorporating design specifications into the framework of the LTR technique for LQG compensator design. The LQG compensator is to simultaneously meet given analytical low- and high-frequency design specifications expressed in terms of desirable sensitivity and controller noise sensitivity functions. The paper is aimed at nonspecialists and, in particular, practitioners in finite-dimensional LQG theory interested in the design of feedback compensators for closed-loop performance and robustness shaping of SISO control systems in realistic situations. The proposed approach is illustrated by a detailed numerical example: the torque control of a current-controlled DC motor with an elastically mounted rotor.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Mahyar Mahinzaeim PhD [view email][v1] Sun, 20 Jul 2025 13:20:36 UTC (738 KB)\n[v2] Mon, 28 Jul 2025 12:47:24 UTC (738 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 20 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Adversarial Destabilization Attacks to Direct Data-Driven Control\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This study investigates the vulnerability of direct data-driven control methods, specifically for the linear quadratic regulator problem, to adversarial perturbations in collected data used for controller synthesis. We consider stealthy attacks that subtly manipulate offline-collected data to destabilize the resulting closed-loop system while evading detection. To generate such perturbations, we propose the Directed Gradient Sign Method (DGSM) and its iterative variant (I-DGSM), adaptations of the fast gradient sign method originally developed for neural networks, which align perturbations with the gradient of the spectral radius of the closed-loop matrix to reduce stability. A key contribution is an efficient gradient computation technique based on implicit differentiation through the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the underlying semidefinite program, enabling scalable and exact gradient evaluation without repeated optimization computations. To defend against these attacks, we propose two defense strategies: a regularization-based approach that enhances robustness by suppressing controller sensitivity to data perturbations and a robust data-driven control approach that guarantees closed-loop stability within bounded perturbation sets. Extensive numerical experiments on benchmark systems show that adversarial perturbations with magnitudes up to ten times smaller than random noise can destabilize controllers trained on corrupted data and that the proposed defense strategies effectively mitigate attack success rates while maintaining control performance. Additionally, we evaluate attack transferability under partial knowledge scenarios, highlighting the practical importance of protecting training data confidentiality.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

While many diverse definitions, architectures, and applications exist, a clear picture is missing on what, in fact, makes a human digital twin. Within this context, researchers and industrial use-case owners alike are unaware about the market potential of the - at the moment - rather theoretical construct. In this work, we draw a holistic vision of the human digital twin, and derive the specification of this holistic human digital twin in form of requirements, stakeholders, and users. For each group of users, we define exemplary applications that fall into the six levels of functionality: store, analyze, personalize, predict, control, and optimize. The functionality levels facilitate an abstraction of abilities of the human digital twin. From the manifold applications, we discuss three in detail to showcase the feasibility of the abstraction levels and the analysis of stakeholders and users. Based on the deep discussion, we derive a comprehensive list of requirements on the holistic human digital twin. These considerations shall be used as a guideline for research and industries for the implementation of human digital twins, particularly in context of reusability in multiple target applications.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.HC\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Physics > Physics and Society\n[Submitted on 19 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Preventing an Extractive Green Hydrogen Industry: Risks and Benefits of Grid Expansion and Green Hydrogen in and for Kenya\nView PDFAbstract:This study evaluates the role of grid-connected hydrogen electrolyzers in advancing a cost-effective and in particular an equitable green hydrogen industry in Kenya to serve both domestic and international needs and markets. Using a multi-nodal capacity expansion model with county-level spatial resolution, we assess how electrolyzer deployment affects electricity cost, grid flexibility, and carbon intensity under various renewable and demand scenarios. Results show that electrolyzers enable up to 30 percent reduction in levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and US\\$460 million in cumulative system cost savings by 2050 compared to a business-as-usual scenario. As a flexible demand available to absorb surplus generation, electrolyzers reduce curtailment and support large-scale wind integration while still requiring a diverse mix of renewable electricity. The resulting hydrogen reaches a levelized cost of \\$3.2 per kg by 2050, and its carbon intensity from electricity use falls below one kg carbon dioxide per kg of hydrogen, suggesting likely compliance with international certification thresholds. Benefits persist across all demand trajectories, though their scale depends on the pace of wind expansion. Spatial analyses reveal unequal distribution of infrastructure gains, underscoring the need for equity-oriented planning. These findings suggest that grid-integrated hydrogen, if planned in coordination with wind investment, transmission, and equitable infrastructure deployment, can reduce costs, support certification, and promote a more equitable model of hydrogen development. In other words, connecting electrolyzers to the grid will not only make green hydrogen in Kenya but also for Kenya.\nCurrent browse context:\nphysics.soc-ph\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 19 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Enhancing Sustainability in HAPS-Assisted 6G Networks: Load Estimation Aware Cell Switching\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This study introduces and addresses the critical challenge of traffic load estimation in cell switching within vertical heterogeneous networks. The effectiveness of cell switching is significantly limited by the lack of accurate traffic load data for small base stations (SBSs) in sleep mode, making many load-dependent energy-saving approaches impractical, as they assume perfect knowledge of traffic loads, an assumption that is unrealistic when SBSs are inactive. In other words, when SBSs are in sleep mode, their traffic loads cannot be directly known and can only be estimated, inevitably with corresponding errors. Rather than proposing a new switching algorithm, we focus on eliminating this foundational barrier by exploring effective prediction techniques. A novel vertical heterogeneous network model is considered, integrating a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) as a super macro base station (SMBS). We investigate both spatial and temporal load estimation approaches, including three spatial interpolation schemes, random neighboring selection, distance based selection, and multi level clustering (MLC), alongside a temporal deep learning method based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Using a real world dataset for empirical validation, our results show that both spatial and temporal methods significantly improve estimation accuracy, with the MLC and LSTM approaches demonstrating particularly strong performance.\nSubmission history\nFrom: Maryam Salamatmoghadasi [view email][v1] Sat, 19 Jul 2025 19:27:57 UTC (1,805 KB)\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

However, the biomechanical mechanisms that enable adaptive gait transitions during high-speed locomotion under load remain poorly understood. In this study, we present new empirical and modeling insights into the biomechanics of load-pulling quadrupeds, using sprint sled dogs as a model system. High-speed video and force recordings reveal that sled dogs often switch between rotary and transverse galloping gaits within just a few strides and without any observable changes in speed, stride duration, or terrain, providing clear evidence of locomotor multistability during high-speed load-pulling. To investigate the mechanical basis of these transitions, a physics-based quadrupedal Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum model with hybrid dynamics and prescribed footfall sequences to reproduce the asymmetric galloping patterns observed in racing sled dogs. Through trajectory optimization, we replicate experimentally observed gait sequences and identify swing-leg stiffness modulation as a key control mechanism for inducing transitions. This work provides a much-needed biomechanical perspective on high-speed animal draft and establishes a modeling framework for studying locomotion in pulling quadrupeds, with implications for both biological understanding and the design of adaptive legged systems.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Information Retrieval\n[Submitted on 19 Jul 2025]\nTitle:RATE: An LLM-Powered Retrieval Augmented Generation Technology-Extraction Pipeline\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:In an era of radical technology transformations, technology maps play a crucial role in enhancing decision making. These maps heavily rely on automated methods of technology extraction. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented Technology Extraction (RATE), a Large Language Model (LLM) based pipeline for automated technology extraction from scientific literature. RATE combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with multi-definition LLM-based validation. This hybrid method results in high recall in candidate generation alongside with high precision in candidate filtering. While the pipeline is designed to be general and widely applicable, we demonstrate its use on 678 research articles focused on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Extended Reality (XR) as a case study. Consequently, The validated technology terms by RATE were mapped into a co-occurrence network, revealing thematic clusters and structural features of the research landscape. For the purpose of evaluation, a gold standard dataset of technologies in 70 selected random articles had been curated by the experts. In addition, a technology extraction model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT) was used as a comparative method. RATE achieved F1-score of 91.27%, Significantly outperforming BERT with F1-score of 53.73%. Our findings highlight the promise of definition-driven LLM methods for technology extraction and mapping. They also offer new insights into emerging trends within the BCI-XR field.

Model Predictive Contour Control (MPCC) has shown promise for performant obstacle avoidance by enabling precise and agile trajectory tracking, however, existing methods lack formal safety assurances. To address this issue, we propose a general Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) enabled MPCC framework that enforces safety constraints derived from a free-space corridor around the planned trajectory. To enhance feasibility, we dynamically adapt the CBF parameters at runtime using a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) policy.

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Networking and Internet Architecture\n[Submitted on 19 Jul 2025]\nTitle:UAV-Enabled Wireless-Powered Underground Communication Networks: A Novel Time Allocation Approach\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:Wireless-powered underground communication networks (WPUCNs), which allow underground devices (UDs) to harvest energy from wireless signals for battery-free communication, offer a promising solution for sustainable underground monitoring. However, the severe wireless signal attenuation in challenging underground environments and the costly acquisition of channel state information (CSI) make large-scale WPUCNs economically infeasible in practice. To address this challenge, we introduce flexible unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into WPUCNs, leading to UAV-enabled WPUCN systems. In this system, a UAV is first charged by a terrestrial hybrid access point (HAP), then flies to the monitoring area to wirelessly charge UDs. Afterwards, the UAV collects data from the UDs and finally returns to the HAP for data offloading. Based on the proposed UAV-enabled WPUCN system, we first propose its energy consumption model and a hybrid wireless energy transfer (WET) approach (i.e., UDs can harvest energy from both the HAP and the UAV) relying on full-CSI and CSI-free multi-antenna beamforming. Then, we formulate and address a time allocation problem to minimize the energy consumption of UAV, while ensuring that the throughput requirements of all UDs are met and all sensor data is offloaded. Through simulations of a realistic farming scenario, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrid WET approach outperforms other WET approaches, with performance gains influenced by the number of antennas, communication distance, number of UDs, and underground conditions. Additionally, under the optimized time allocation, we found that the proposed hybrid WET approach based on a CSI-free multi-antenna scheme achieves the lowest UAV's energy consumption among all WET mechanisms, thereby enabling sustainable underground monitoring in WPUCNs.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.NI\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The core of our approach is a delayed confidence learning procedure that optimizes a confidence parameter online, adaptively balancing between ML and nominal predictions. We establish formal competitive ratio bounds for general nonlinear systems under standard MPC regularity assumptions. For the linear quadratic case, we derive a competitive ratio bound that is provably tight, thereby characterizing the fundamental limits of this learning-augmented approach.

    "abstract": "Computer Science > Artificial Intelligence\n[Submitted on 18 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Fail Fast, or Ask: Mitigating the Deficiencies of Reasoning LLMs with Human-in-the-Loop Systems Engineering\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:State-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are powerful problem solvers, but they still occasionally make mistakes. However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive domains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose collaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries the model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty of a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an effective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3 235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring 7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them challenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this challenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning model. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system \"Fail Fast, or Ask\", since the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert directly (\"failing fast\"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher latency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and about 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the accuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower than expected because of \"latency drag\", the phenomenon that processing easier queries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency distribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the deficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and high latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems engineering, without requiring access to LLM internals.\nCurrent browse context:\ncs.AI\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 18 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Bi-level Model Predictive Control for Energy-aware Integrated Product Pricing and Production Scheduling\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:The manufacturing industry is under growing pressure to enhance sustainability while preserving economic competitiveness. As a result, manufacturers have been trying to determine how to integrate onsite renewable energy and real-time electricity pricing into manufacturing schedules without compromising profitability. To address this challenge, we propose a bi-level model predictive control framework that jointly optimizes product prices and production scheduling with explicit consideration of renewable energy availability. The higher level determines the product price to maximize revenue and renewable energy usage. The lower level controls production scheduling in runtime to minimize operational costs and respond to the product demand. Price elasticity is incorporated to model market response, allowing the system to increase demand by lowering the product price during high renewable energy generation. Results from a lithium-ion battery pack manufacturing system case study demonstrate that our approach enables manufacturers to reduce grid energy costs while increasing profit.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Remote Assistance or Remote Driving: The Impact of Operational Design\n  Domains on ADS-Supporting Systems Selection",
    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 18 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Remote Assistance or Remote Driving: The Impact of Operational Design Domains on ADS-Supporting Systems Selection\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:High level Automated Driving Systems (ADS) can handle many situations, but they still encounter situations where human intervention is required. In systems where a physical driver is present in the vehicle, typically SAE Level 3 systems, this intervention is relatively straightforward and is handled by the in-vehicle driver. However, the complexity increases for Level 4 systems, where, in most cases, no physical driver remains in the vehicle. The two common industry solutions for this challenge are the integration of a remote support system, such as a Remote Driving System (RDS) or Remote Assistance System (RAS). While it is clear that ADS will require one of these systems, it is less clear how the suitability of either system for a particular ADS application should be evaluated. Currently, the selection process often focuses on system architecture as well as its design and integration challenges. Furthermore, since many ADS developers choose to develop remote system solutions in-house, it is advantageous to select the simpler approach to streamline development and integration efforts. While these decision points are certainly relevant, this approach overlooks the most critical factors: the use cases and the complementarity of the ADS and the remote support system within the context of the Operational Design Design Domain (ODD). This paper proposes a structured approach for selecting between RDS and RAS as an ADS support system, based on the defined ODD and use case analysis. To achieve this, the paper applies the PEGASUS framework to systematically describe and analyze the ODD. A structured framework is introduced to evaluate and select the most suitable remote support system for an ADS based on clearly defined criteria.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

    "title": "Distributed consensus-based observer design for target state estimation\n  with bearing measurements",
    "abstract": "Electrical Engineering and Systems Science > Systems and Control\n[Submitted on 18 Jul 2025]\nTitle:Distributed consensus-based observer design for target state estimation with bearing measurements\nView PDF HTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper introduces a novel distributed consensus-based observer design that enables a group of agents in an undirected communication network to solve the problem of target tracking, where the target is modeled as a chain of integrators of arbitrary order. Each agent is assumed to know its own position and simultaneously measure bearing vectors relative to the target. We start by introducing a general continuous time observer design tailored to systems whose state dynamics are modeled as chains of integrators and whose measurement model follows a particular nonlinear but observer-suited form. This design leverages a correction term that combines innovation and consensus components, allowing each agent to broadcast only a part of the state estimate to its neighbours, which effectively reduces the data flowing across the network. To provide uniform exponential stability guarantees, a novel result for a class of nonlinear closed-loop systems in a generalized observer form is introduced and subsequently used as the main tool to derive stability conditions on the observer gains. Then, by exploring the properties of orthogonal projection matrices, the proposed design is used to solve the distributed target tracking problem and provide explicit stability conditions that depend on the target-agents geometric formation. Practical examples are derived for a target modeled as first-, second-, and third-order integrator dynamics, highlighting the design procedure and the stability conditions imposed. Finally, numerical results showcase the properties of the proposed algorithm.\nCurrent browse context:\neess.SY\nReferences & Citations\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\nalphaXiv (What is alphaXiv?)\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\nGotit.pub (What is GotitPub?)\nHugging Face (What is Huggingface?)\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\nDemos\nRecommenders and Search Tools\nInfluence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?
