3.3 Cementing Conduit:

a. Cementing of conduit shall be in accordance
with ASTM D2855, Standard Practice for the
Two-Step Method of Joining PVC Pipe and
Piping Components with Tapered Socket,
except as modified herein.

b. Cement and primer shall be applied using
a manufacturer’s approved roller or swab.

c. All PVC pipes shall be wiped clean of dirt
or water and cut pipe ends’ shall be
chamfered and de-burred, prior to primer
application.

d. PVC primer and cement are fast drying
products. They shall be applied as quickly
as is consistent with the manufacturers’
recommendations.

-37-


=== PAGE 39 ===
Apply primer with the applicator once to
the inside of the socket, and once to the
outside of the spigot end over a length
equal to the depth of the socket.

While the primer on the spigot and socket
is still wet, apply the cement with the
applicator once to the inside of the socket
and once to the outside of the spigot end
over a length equal to the depth of the
socket. The quantity of glue applied should
be sufficient to wet the pipe. Excess cement
on the socket should be avoided as it is
wiped into the joint and tends to weaken
the pipe.

If the primer has dried prior to applying
the cement or if the cement has dried prior
to joining the two pipes, both primer and
the cement must be reapplied. The joint must
be assembled immediately after the last
cement application.

Slip conduit straight into the socket until
it bottoms, twist approximately %’ turn then
hold the joint for 15 seconds (One (1)
minute in extreme cold weather), so that
the conduit does not push out of the
fitting.

Do not twist or drive pipe after insertion
is completed. No blows by hammer or by any
other means shall be used to aid the
assembly of the PVC conduit joints.

Another fitting or duct section can be added
to the free end of the conduit, within two
or three minutes if care is exercised in
handling so that strain is not placed on
the previously joined assembly.

Under normal circumstances, the newly
joined members shall remain undisturbed for
at least five minutes befor they are
handled. In cold or damp weather, this
interval should be increased to allow for
the slower evaporation of the solvent.

- 38 -


=== PAGE 40 ===
.4

a.

b.

After initial set, care must b xercised
in handling the conduit to prevent twisting
or pulling the joint.

Wipe off the excess solvent that is left on
the outer shoulder of the fitting after the
joint is assembled. Plastic bristle brushes
should not be used for this purpose.

Keep cement cans covered when not in use
and always keep them away from excess heat
and flames.

Solvent cement thinner may not be used for
thinning cement that has thickened.

All discarded cement and primer cans are to
be removed from the open trench and properly
disposed of prior to conduit encasement and
trench backfilling.

All cut bends of PVC conduit shall be
assembled in the presence of the Department
of Water and Power (Department)
representative or otherwise approved by
Said representative.

Conduit Bend Radius:

Minimum bend radius for straight conduit
that is to be cold bent in the trench is as
follows:

Conduit size IPS Minimum Radius
(Inches) (Feet)
3 12-1/2
3 to 6 65

Hot bending of PVC conduit is not allowed in
the field.

=== PAGE 41 ===
3.5 Mechanical Damage Prevention Recommendations:

a.

b.

Cc.

Conduit should not be left exposed in open
trench for longer than eight hours.

h

Provide support for the full length ot
conduit when transporting long conduit
lengths.

(T Ff

Do not permit unsupported overhangs.

4. PVC TEMPERATURE EFFECT PRECAUTIONS

Due to the expansion and contraction of plastic
inches per 100 feet for every 20 degrees

duct (1-1/2
Fahrenheit

(F’)

change in temperature), the following

precautions should be taken:

4.1 Temperature Precautions

a.

All plastic conduit and fittings to be
joined should be exposed to the same
temperature conditions for a reasonable
length of time before assembly.

Allow extra conduit footage at each tie-in
for contraction when duct temperature is
higher than that of the surrounding soil; or
extra room for expansion if the reverse
condition exists.

When pouring concrete over conduit in
encased buried or placing backfill in direct
buried, the contractor shall allow for
temperature-induced movement at the free end
of the conduit. This can be accomplished by
pouring the concrete or placing the backfill
from the center of the run (if both ends of
the run are open) or starting from the tie-
in point and working towards the free end.
This is extremely important for concrete
encasement since conduit is subject to
temperature rise as concrete cures.

knife or equivalent.

Fiberglass Conduit Assembly:

All bell and spigot ends of the fiberglass
conduits shall be sanded and cleaned to remove
any transit residues.

After sanding, cleaning, and drying the bell
and spigot ends of the fiberglass conduits, a
liberal and uniform coat of epoxy resin shall
be applied to both the interior of the bell
and the exterior of the spigot, covering a
four (4) inch wide section.

Due to the pot life of the epoxy resin, the
joint shall be assembled immediately after the
last epoxy application. If the epoxy resin
dries before assembly, the bell and spigot
ends of the fiberglass conduits must be re-
sanded and cleaned befor applying any
additional epoxy.

joining bell with a slight twist until it
bottoms. The joint members shall be cured and

L£ L£

left undisturbed for 30 minutes or more before

they are handled and/or transferred. After
this initial set, care must b xercised in
handling to prevent twisting or pulling the
joint.

e. An approved soft paddle may be used to aid the
assembly of the fiberglass conduit joints.
Partial mixing of the resin and hardener will
not be allowed.

7. DIRECT BURIED CONDUIT INSTALLATION

7.1 There shall be a minimum of 2-inch spacing
maintained between all adjacent conduits. Duct spacers or 2-
inch sand layers shall be used if conduits are placed on the
top of each other. Refer to sscTioN1IO of this Appendix for
requirements relating to duct spacers.

7.2 The trench must be uniformly graded and the
bottom shall be smooth and rock free. In the event of a rocky
bottom, a 4-inch bed of sand or sand slurry will be required.

8. ENCASED BURIED CONDUIT INSTALLATION

8.1(a) Maintain a minimum of 2-inch spacing
between adjacent conduits.

8.1(b) Maintain a minimum of 3-inch and a maximum
of 6-inch concrete cover on top, bottom, and sides of a single

L£

conduit or around a group of conduits in a duct-bank.

8.1(c) For spacer specifications refer to — SECTION 10
of this Appendix.

8.2 Tie and fasten all conduits in a multi conduit
run with "All-State Nylon Cable Ties", catalog No. 12050, or
equivalent to prevent floating.

8.3 Whenever smaller diameter conduits are placed
in spacers intended for larger size conduits, all such
conduits shall be securely tied to the spacers with ‘‘All1-
States Nylon Cable Ties", Catalog No. 12050, or eguivalent.
This is to provide lateral stability to the spacers and to
avoid floating of the smaller diameter conduits during the
concret ncasement process.

8.4 The concrete for encasement shall not be
placed until the conduit has been inspected and approved by
the Department representative in accordance with SscTION AS of
Specifications 104.

shall be constructed in accordance with Department Standard
Number 1-120.1, latest revision.

11.2 All DB and EB conduits shall enter vaults,
maintenance holes, and handholes perpendicular to the wall
and shall terminate with end bells or duct terminators (end
bells or duct terminators are not reguired for 1, 2 and 3
inch conduits). The end bells or duct terminators shall be
flush with the inside face of the knockout, and shall be
rounded and smooth. No rough edges will be accepted.

11.3 Cap all free conduit ends at the dead-end
points with tapered polyethylene plugs with a nipple. The
tapered polyethylene plugs shall be securely taped to the PVC
conduit with reinforced tape. Use Jack Moon Company, limited
(JMC) Blank Duct Plugs with nipple or equivalent in place of
the tapered polyethylene plugs in high water table areas,
clayey soil, or as directed by the Department representative.

11.4 Cap all free conduit ends, inside precast
concrete pad-mount hand-holes, with plastic plugs with a
nipple.

11.5 Cap all end bells or duct terminators, inside
pre-cast concrete vaults, maintenance holes and regular
hand-hole substructures with JMC Blank Duct Plugs with
nipple or equivalent.
