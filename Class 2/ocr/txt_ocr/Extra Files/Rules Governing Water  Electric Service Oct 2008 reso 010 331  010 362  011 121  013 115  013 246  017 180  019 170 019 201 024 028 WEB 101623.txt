RULE NO. 2

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE

PART 2-W DESCRIPTION OF WATER SERVICE

A.

Supply and Pressure

The Department will endeavor to render a dependable supply of potable water, from available sources, in quantities adequate to
meet the reasonable needs of its Customers. The delivery of such supply will be at the Service Connection.

Generally, the Department will maintain operating pressures at the Service Connection of not less than 25 pounds per square inch.
Pressures may be lower at times of Maximum Demand or because of unusual elevations or other special conditions.

. Impairment of Service to Other Customers

Where the use of water is unusually intermittent or is subject to violent fluctuations of a character that may impair service to other
Customers, the Department may require that the Customer provide, at the Customer's own expense, suitable equipment to
reasonably limit fluctuations in use and pressures caused by the Customer's equipment or operations.

. Other Conditions to Service

Before water service will be provided by the Department, the Customer shall obtain any approval of Customer-installed or
furnished facilities required by the Department of Building and Safety or the Fire Department of the City of Los Angeles or any
other authority whose approval is required by law.


=== PAGE 11 ===
PART 2-E DESCRIPTION OF ELECTRIC SERVICE

D. Alternating Current

1.

Frequency, Voltage, and Phase

a.

Service supplied will be alternating current at a regulated frequency of 60 Hz. Voltage values stated herein are nominal
although reasonable variations may occur in actual values thereof, as well as in other conditions of service.

Single-phase service is generally supplied at 120 volts, through two Wires, or at 240/120 volts through three Wires.
Single-phase loads, when supplied at 240/120 volts, must be reasonably balanced between the two energized Conductors
of the service with respect to the neutral Wire. Single-phase loads with a service Ampacity of 600 amperes or less at
240/120 volts normally will be supplied through one main meter. Where such service Ampacity is in excess of 600
amperes, approval must be obtained from the Department regarding metering requirements and related facilities,
including switches and Circuits.

. Three-phase service is generally supplied at 240/120 volts, 480 Y/277 volts, and 208 Y/120 volts through four Wires with

the fourth Wire grounded. However, services at 208 Y/120 volts or 480 Y/277 volts are of special character and require
sufficient connected load to warrant spot transformation. Load connected to a three-phase service shall be reasonably
balanced between the phases. The Department shall not be required to supply three-phase service in any single-family
residential district area.

A combination of 240-volt, three-phase and 240/120 volt, single-phase service will normally be furnished through four
Wires. The fourth Wire will be grounded. The single-phase portion of the load shall be reasonably balanced between the
phase Conductors with respect to the neutral Wire. The three-phase portion of the load shall be reasonably balanced
between phases. When service is supplied in this manner, large motors, welders, or x-ray equipment, whether single-
phase or three-phase, may cause Circuit Voltage fluctuation (light flicker). The Customer must obtain Department
approval prior to installing such equipment. If at any time, the character or size of the loads, in the opinion of the
Department, makes it reasonably necessary to separate the three-phase and single-phase services, all necessary
equipment required to receive the separate services shall be supplied by the Customer.

The Department will not be required to supply service in excess of 1500 kVA at 240/120 volts or less or in excess of
3750 kVA at 480 Y/277 volts, either three-Wire or four-Wire. When larger capacity is required, the load may be served
at high Voltage or two or more services may be installed at the same location.

For services in excess of 1500 kVA, the service Voltage must be 480Y/277 volts or higher. For services in excess of
3750 kVA, the service Voltage must be 4160 Y/2400 volts or higher. For services in excess of 30 MVA, the service
Voltage must be 34,500 volts. For services of 80 MVA or greater, the service Voltage may be 138,000 volts provided at
the sole discretion of the Department. Service voltage provided at 138,000 volts is limited to availability on the
Department’s system, and will be available only if determined to be feasible following comprehensive transmission
studies. All equipment or structures on customer premises necessary for the utilization of service delivered by the
Department from 138,000 volts or above shall be owned and maintained by the Customer. However, some equipment
may be installed by the Department on the Customer’s premises. All conduit and conductors required from the nearest
138,000 volt source to the Service Point will be installed by the Department and the cost paid by the Customer. If the
Customer requests to be served at a lower service Voltage than that of the guidelines, the Customer will pay for the
additional installation cost.

The Department may furnish primary service (at 4800 volts, 34,500 volts, or other Voltages as may be specified by the
Department) only when, in its opinion, the size or special character of the load, or the location thereof, warrants
furnishing service on such basis. In the event the Department has determined that service will be provided at 4800 volts,
the Customer must first agree to comply with any special conditions imposed by the Department.

Services separately metered may be totalized at a Customer’s request, or for the Department's convenience, provided the
Customer's equipment configurations conform to the Electric Service Requirements. Loads fed separately from the
subtransmission and primary systems will not be totalized.


=== PAGE 12 ===
Gaseous Tube Lighting

When gaseous tube lighting equipment or systems of any type or size are to be served, the Department will require that the
Customer provide at the Customer's expense, power factor corrective apparatus to increase the operating power factor of
each complete unit or system to not less than 90 percent (lagging or leading). Such correction will be required with each
"tube-rated" unit of 15 watts or over and where such auxiliaries are used for individual fixtures, they shall be similarly
corrected. Each tube transformer having manufacturers' rating over 150 volt-amperes and used with gaseous tube systems or
signs shall be equipped to provide such power factor correction.

Motor Loads

a. General

Motor loads may be served under any rate schedule which provides for service to power loads for general purposes, but
subject to other applicable provisions of the Department's Rules.

b. Single-Phase Service

d)

(2)

(3)

Any single-phase motor having locked-rotor current not exceeding 46 amperes, and full-load running current not
exceeding 12 amperes, may be operated at 120 volts.

Single-phase, 240-volt motors installed for residential air conditioning shall be limited so that the arithmetical sum
of the locked rotor currents of all motors in a particular unit shall not exceed 450 percent of the similar sum of full-
load currents nor a total of 150 amperes.

Single-phase motors of five hp or more may be connected to a service supplying lighting only upon special
permission from, and in the manner specified by, the Department.

c. Polyphase Service

d)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

Three-phase service generally will be supplied for motor installations aggregating more than five hp. Such service
generally will not be otherwise limited as to capacity, either of individual motors or of the installation in aggregate.
The Department may, however, require that large installations be served from transformer stations located on the
Premises of Customers, in accordance with the provisions set forth in Rule No. 16 titled "SERVICE
CONNECTIONS AND CUSTOMER'S FACILITIES" except as otherwise provided in the following subparagraph
(2), service will generally be at 240 volts.

When the load is to be supplied from overhead distribution facilities, three-phase service at 480 volts may be
supplied for motor installations where the aggregate load at 480 volts is 50 hp or more; and the Department may
not be required to continue service at such Voltage if connected load is reduced below 50 hp at 480 volts. When
load is to be supplied from secondary Voltage underground distribution facilities, approval of the Department
engineers must be obtained in advance for any 480-volt, three-phase service.

Polyphase motors not exceeding 20 hp each and designed for "across-the-line starting" may be connected to the
Department's system, for either constant or intermittent duty operation, provided the starting kVA demand does not

exceed six kVA per rated hp.

Polyphase motors in excess of 20 hp, but not more than 50 hp each and designed for "across-the-line starting"
require approval of the Department before they may be connected to its electric system.

Polyphase motors of capacity exceeding 50 hp each will require special approval by the Department, and the
following information shall be furnished to the Department in writing before such approval will be considered:

10


=== PAGE 13 ===
(a) Rated hp;
(b) Motor type;
(c) Starting current test or guaranteed locked-rotor current;
(d) Duty - constant or intermittent, and maximum number of starts in an eight-hour period; and
(e) Whether more than one motor is to be started simultaneously from a single control.
Heating, Cooking, and Miscellaneous Power Loads
a. General
Single-phase commercial cooking and heating loads and other miscellaneous single-phase power loads may, at the
option of the Department, be supplied through a three-phase service at 240 volts. However, approval for such service
shall be obtained in advance if none of the individual loads to be supplied is three-phase.
b. X-Ray Units Over Five kVA

When x-ray equipment in units exceeding five kVA in capacity is to be supplied, Department approval must be obtained
on the proposed method of connection before installing any such equipment.

c. Welders

(1) Any welder exceeding three-kVA capacity when supplied through a residential service requires approval by the
Department prior to installation.

(2) All welders for commercial or industrial use (of gun, butt, seam, flash, or similar type) of 15-kVA capacity or more
require approval by the Department prior to installation. Welders having a rating in excess of 15 kVA may require
special serving facilities. Service thereto will be subject to provisions of the following subparagraph (3).

(3) Single-phase welders may be served through a three-phase service provided the individual single-phase load units
are equally distributed among the three phases; if such single-phase units are not so distributed, approval by the
Department, before service is supplied, must be obtained as to maximum permissible unbalance between phases,
and the two Conductors supplying the greatest single-phase load shall be suitably tagged or otherwise identified at
the point of connection to the service Conductors.

E. General Provisions

1.

Impairment of Service

The Department may require that any load installation, where the use of electricity is unusually intermittent or is subject to
significant fluctuations, as in the case of hoists, welders, furnaces and equipment of a character that may impair service to
other Customers, be supplied through a service separate from all other loads. The Customer may provide, at the Customer's
own expense, suitable equipment to reasonably limit the voltage fluctuations caused by the equipment involved.

Special Power Apparatus
Arc rectifying devices, x-ray equipment, high-Voltage testing and bombarding transformers, Wireless telegraph or radio

transmitting equipment, electric welders and furnaces, and other equipment with similar load characteristics will be
considered as power apparatus and therefore are subject to provisions of subsection F of this Rule.

11


=== PAGE 14 ===
Other Conditions of Service

All equipment and loads of the Customer are subject to provisions of the "Electric Service Requirements" of the Department
of Water and Power, as established pursuant to Rule No. 16 titled "SERVICE CONNECTIONS AND CUSTOMER'S
FACILITIES." Services and all conditions related thereto, are also subject to applicable provisions of other Rules.

Approval by the Department of Building and Safety of the City of Los Angeles, and by any other authority whose approval
is required by law, shall be obtained by the Customer for any installation furnished and/or installed by the Customer before
installation will be energized by the Department of Water and Power.

Revenue Insufficient to Warrant Expense

Whenever the estimated revenue, in the sole discretion of the Department, from a proposed new service, or a proposed
increase in load on an existing service or from a proposed renewal of a discontinued service, does not justify the additional
investment necessary, the Department may disallow, in whole or in part, any allowances as provided for in Rule No. 15
titled "DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM EXTENSIONS" or may require suitable guarantees which will warrant making
expenditure for the service.

F. Connected Load and Maximum Demand

1.

Change of Connected Load

In the event that the Customer shall make any material change either in the amount or character of the electrical load
connected upon the Customer's Premises and supplied with electric energy by the Department, the Customer shall
immediately give the Department written notice of the fact so that, if necessary, the Department may change its line and/or
service equipment.

Connected Load

a. General
The Customer's "Connected Load" shall signify the rated capacity of the maximum load that can be energized directly
and simultaneously from the Department's lines. Such "Connected Load" shall be expressed only to the nearest 1/10
(0.1) kW. For the purpose of applying rates, the following shall be considered as equivalent to one kW of connected
load:
Three-fourths (3/4) multiplied by each hp of rated capacity of standard motors,
Each kVA maximum input rating of mercury arc, tungar, and dry-plate rectifier units,
Each kW of rated capacity of other stationary apparatus, except standard distribution transformers,
Each kVA of standard distribution transformer capacity, and Each kVA of output capacity of frequency changers.
In cases of resistance, welding devices, x-ray units, and other installations where energy demand is intermittent or
subject to severe fluctuations or in case of multiple-rated motors or where connected loads are indeterminate or transient
in nature, the basis on which determination of connected load shall be made is reserved to the Department through its
authorized representatives. Manufacturers' equipment ratings will be used where practicable although the right to
establish maximum input or output in each individual case is reserved to the Department through its authorized
representatives.
In the event the Customer requests or the Department determines that it is necessary to provide capacity greater than is

normally provided for such equipment, establishment of a rating for the equipment will be made by the Department
through its authorized representatives.

12


=== PAGE 15 ===
b. Indeterminate and Transient Loads
(1) Rating Plate Not Correct, Incomplete or Missing
When the rating plate on any unit of load is not correct for any reason or the name plate is missing, a rating for such
unit on the basis of ratings of similar standard equipment or as provided in these Rules will be established by the
Department through its authorized representatives and "Connected Loads" shall be determined on the basis of such
rating.
(2) Test Panels or Test Circuits
All testing panels or testing Circuits shall be considered as "Connected Load" on the basis of the maximum
capacity. The Circuit or panel shall be limited to such capacity by a suitable load limiting device acceptable to the
Department.
(3) Portable Loads
Portable loads for use on a Customer's Premises shall be counted as "Connected Load" on the basis of the sum of
the ratings of the largest units of load that are simultaneously used as determined by the Department through its
authorized representatives.
c. Synchronous or Static Condensers (Capacitors), Regulators, Balancers, and Similar Devices
Where a condenser is used solely for the purpose of correcting power factor, or where it is determined by the
Department that a regulator, balance, or any other device is installed by the Customer solely for the purpose of
maintaining favorable Voltage or load characteristics, such equipment shall not be considered as "Connected Load."

Auto Transformers

The load connected to an auto transformer shall be considered as energized directly from the Department's lines and such
load, and not the auto transformer itself, shall be considered as "Connected Load."

e. Control Apparatus
Control apparatus such as overload or under Voltage relays, pilot lights, magnetic brake releases, and control panels on
freight and passenger elevators, automatic printing press controls, and any device acting in an auxiliary way to control
motor-operated machines shall not be counted as "Connected Load."

Maximum Demand

a. In administration or application of rates, Maximum Demands may be established as estimates founded on Department
tests or other reasonable bases, under circumstances as follows:

(1) For limited interim periods pending installation of demand indicating meters following initiation of service or
otherwise.

(2) When installation of demand indicating meters may not be practical or necessary, generally where load is either
small or use is notably uniform.

b. Where demands are intermittent or subject to severe fluctuations and Maximum Demand is to be based on transformer

capacity, as provided for by rate ordinance, such Maximum Demand shall be established in accordance with the
following:

13


=== PAGE 16 ===
d)

(2)

(3)

General

Transformer capacity required to serve shall be determined by Department engineers where the Customer's load
includes units whose character and use is such that required capacity is not adequately indicated by average demand
recorded by meters. In cases where Billing Demand respecting total service, as prescribed by rate ordinance, is
based on average demand recorded by meters and it exceeds the amount of transformer capacity determinable
hereunder, such capacity shall be disregarded for application of rates.

Welders and X-Rays

Where Customer's load includes resistance-type welders or x-ray equipment, transformer capacity required to serve
shall be determined in accordance with the following:

(a) Such transformer capacity shall be deemed equivalent to capacity of welder and/or x-ray equipment in cases
where only a single unit of such equipment is involved.

(b) Such transformer capacity shall be specifically determined, as provided in subparagraph F.3.b (2) (a) of this
Rule, in each case where more than a single unit of such welder or x-ray equipment is involved. In such
determination, consideration will be given to relevant factors such as number and types of units, character of
operation thereof, and distribution among phases of service.

Test Services, Special Capacity Contracts, and Miscellaneous Other Pertinent Circumstances.
Required transformer capacity, as a basis for establishing Maximum Demand, where Customer's load includes test
equipment or other units not covered by subparagraph F.3.b (2) of this Rule, shall be specifically determined in

each case as provided under subparagraph F.3.b (1) of this Rule, considering type and operation of units, amount of
transformer capacity especially contracted for, and any other pertinent circumstance.

14


=== PAGE 17 ===
RULE NO. 3

APPLICATION FOR SERVICE

A. General

Each prospective Customer, or agent of the Customer, shall apply for the service desired, establish credit as required by
these Rules, and pay a Start Service Charge.

An application may be made in person at any business office of the Department or to a duly authorized representative by
phone, mail, or the Internet.

In the event the Customer is a corporation, the Department considers the Customer to be the corporation as it exists at the
time of the application for service. Any dissolution, merger, consolidation, or other reorganization of the corporation, or the
sale or other transfer of the assets of the corporation in an amount greater than ten percent, or the sale or other transfer of
stock ownership of the corporation, voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law, greater than ten percent shall be
deemed a termination of service and a request for new service and therefore is subject to the provisions of those Rules
concerning new service and termination of service, including the establishment and/or reestablishment of credit.
Continuation of any deposits on file with the Department shall require the consent of the previous owner. Failing such
consent, a new deposit will be required. The provisions of this Rule shall not apply to corporations, the stock of which is
listed on and traded through a recognized exchange.

In the event the Customer is a partnership, the Department considers the Customer to be the partnership as it currently
exists. A withdrawal or change, voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law of any partner or the dissolution of the
partnership shall be deemed a termination of service and a request for new service and therefore is subject to the provisions
of these Rules concerning new service and termination of service, including the establishment and/or reestablishment of
credit.

In the event the Premises at which the Customer is receiving service is a leased Premises, any transfer of the lease,
voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law, shall be deemed a termination of service and a request for new service and
therefore is subject to the provisions of those Rules concerning new service and termination of service including the
establishment and/or reestablishment of credit.

In the event the application is for master-metered residential service, unpaid bills are deemed to be the responsibility of the
property owner in that this service constitutes a special benefit to such property. A public or private auction sale resulting
from a foreclosure results in the purchaser being deemed the Department's Customer from the date of the auction purchase.

As a condition of service and continuation of service, any corporation, partnership, or Customer subject to the provisions of
this Rule, or to which the provisions of this Rule become applicable, shall notify the Department in writing in advance of
such event. Failure to notify the Department shall be grounds for immediate termination of service.

The application is a request for service. It does not, in itself, require the Department to serve the Customer nor does it
require the Customer to take service if the application is accepted, for a period longer than the minimum period required
under the rate ordinance. The Department's refusal to serve shall be based upon these Rules, and service at any time shall be
rendered only under reasonable conditions and in accordance with these Rules.

Acceptance of applications for service to Customers located outside of the City but within the Los Angeles Metropolitan
Area is at the Department's option and may be subject to approval by the Board. Only surplus water or electricity, owned or
controlled by the City and not required for use of Customers served by the City within its limits, may be supplied or
distributed outside the City.

A Start Service Charge per Premises shall be established from time to time by the General Manager and shall be collected from
each Applicant for starting water and/or electric service to the Premises.

If the application is for a change of name on an established account which does not require a closing bill, there shall be no charge.

A Customer who converts master-Metered Services to individually metered Electric Services may have the Start Service Charge
waived, at the initial conversion only, when services are retained in the Customer's name.

. Maintenance of Electric Service Application

A Customer may place a Landlord Agreement on file for the purpose of maintaining continuous electric service in rental units when
tenants move out, if the following requirements are met:

1. The Customer must be the Customer of record for the common water service or services.

2. There must be at least one individually metered electric service.

3. The services must be at the same or contiguous addresses within a complex of rental units.

4. The common water service or services and all electric services covered by the Landlord Agreement must be in the same

16


=== PAGE 19 ===
F. Type of Water Service Requirements

The Department's requirements for the type of water service desired must be met before an application will be approved. If the
water main, Service Connection, or meter required for service to the Premises has not been installed and/or paid for, the Applicant
will be informed of the terms and conditions which must be met before an application for service will be approved.

G. Failure to Pay Charges Owed as Former Customer

When an application for service is made by a former Customer who has failed to pay charges owed to the Department, service may
be refused until such charges are paid and Customer establishes credit as required in Rule No. 6.

H. Use of Water or Electricity Without Application for Service

Any person, persons, association, corporation, or entity using water or electricity without making proper application for such
service shall be responsible for all charges for the service. The amount of such charges shall be determined by the Department
either by meter reading or on the basis of the estimated consumption for the time the service was used. Liability for charges due is
in addition to any other civil or criminal penalty authorized by law.

When the Department finds that water or electricity is being used without proper application for service or Service Connection, the

service may be discontinued without notice. If such use of water or electricity is unsafe or hazardous, the service may be
discontinued in the manner prescribed in Rule No. 11 titled "DISCONTINUANCE AND RESTORATION OF SERVICE."

20


=== PAGE 23 ===
RULE NO. 6

ESTABLISHMENT AND REESTABLISHMENT OF CREDIT

A. Establishment and Maintenance of Credit

Each Applicant for water or electric service may be required to furnish and maintain a satisfactory guaranty, by deposit or
otherwise, for payment of charges in connection with such service, provided that such guaranty may not be required where it
appears to the Department that the Applicant's credit is sufficient to assure payment of any such charges as they become due.
Unless the guaranty is required, each Applicant's credit shall be deemed established and thereafter maintained until any bill
rendered by the Department for service has become delinquent or until information is obtained which indicates that the Customer's
credit has been impaired. Whenever it is deemed necessary because of delinquency in payment, or otherwise, that the Customer be
required to reestablish credit, the Department will mail or deliver to the Customer a suitable written notice.

When the Applicant is a limited partnership, the Department will evaluate the credit standing of the limited partnership, the general
partner and the limited partners. The Department may in its discretion deny such credit unless the following occurs: (i) That an
individual or corporation having an acceptable credit standing agrees to be liable for the obligations resulting from the Department's
furnishing service; or (ii) That a limited partner, having an acceptable credit rating, (whether an individual, corporation, or
partnership) agrees to be a surety for the limited partnership or guarantees the obligations of the limited partnership resulting from
the furnishing of service. The individual or corporation agreeing to be liable for the obligations arising from furnishing of service
must do so independently of the limited partnership and not be a participant in the control of the business as a general partner.

B. Reestablishment of Credit

Any Customer may be required to reestablish credit in any of the following cases:

1. If Customer's deposit has been applied, in whole or in part, to the payment of any bill or bills for service;

2. If the Applicant was a water or electric Customer of the Department and service was discontinued for cause;

3. If the Customer's credit has not been maintained as required by this Rule;

4. If, for any reason, the guaranty furnished by the Customer becomes inadequate under the provisions of this Rule; or

5. If a Customer must reapply for service under provisions of Rule No. 3.A.3.

6. If a Customer owns master-metered residential property which, within the last two years, had an application for a lien and/or

a lien for public utilities filed against that property while owned by the Customer.

21


=== PAGE 24 ===
RULE NO.7

DEPOSITS

A. Amount of Deposit

1. Where the Residential Applicant or Customer is required to make a deposit, pursuant to Rule No. 6 titled “Establishment
and Reestablishment of Credit,” either for guaranteeing payment of charges for service or for re-establishment of credit, the
amount thereof shall generally not exceed a sum equal to the average bill for service as estimated for two billing periods.

Where the Non-Residential Applicant or Customer is required to make a deposit either for guaranteeing payment of charges
for service or for re-establishment of credit, the amount thereof shall be no less than two times the average periodic bill or
three times the estimated average monthly bill.

In any event, for a Residential or Non-Residential Applicant or Customer, the deposit shall not be less than a minimum
amount to be determined from time to time by the General Manager.

2. When a Customer's credit record indicates to the Department that the Customer poses a risk that the bills rendered at any
location at which the Customer is receiving service may not be paid, in the Department's discretion, a deposit larger than the
amount of deposit set forth in subparagraph A.1 of this Rule may be required for any such location prior to continuation of
service. A risk that the bill will be unpaid occurs when the Customer has been delinquent in payment of bills; the Customer's
service has been shut off on one or more occasion; the Customer is delinquent at other locations than the location at which
service is being rendered, or when credit reports or any other indications are received that the credit of the Customer may be
impaired. The deposit will be fixed in an amount at which the Department will not be required to risk a loss as the result of
nonpayment of bills.

B. Disposition of Deposit

When a Customer has furnished a deposit to guarantee payment of Department bills, and service has been terminated, such deposit
will be refunded to the Customer after deduction of any unpaid charges or indebtedness due to the Department.

C. Deposit for Temporary Service
This Rule shall not apply to any deposit as may be required in conjunction with supplying of Temporary Service.
D. Interest on Deposits
The Department will pay simple interest on cash deposits held to guarantee payment of bills from the date the deposit is paid in full

at a rate to be determined from time to time by the General Manager, computed on a daily basis. Such interest will be paid at the
time the deposit is applied to the Customer's account or refunded.

22


=== PAGE 25 ===
RULE NO. 8

NOTICES

A. Meter Reading and Billing

When notices from the Department to a Customer are required, they will normally be given in writing, either mailed to the address
specified by the Customer for the receipt of notices, or delivered to the service address, except that in emergencies, the Department
may give oral notices. Required written notices will either be mailed to the address specified by the Customer for receipt of notices,
or delivered or mailed to the service address, or in the case of master-metered residential accounts, mailed to the property owner as
identified on the latest equalized tax roll at the address listed for mailing of the tax bill.

B. Notices from Customers
Notices from a Customer to the Department may be given in writing mailed to any business office of the Department or may be

given orally by the Customer or agent of the Customer at any business office of the Department or by phone except when written
notice is specifically required by law or by these Rules or by ordinance. Notices written on the bill will not be effective.

23


=== PAGE 26 ===
RULE NO.9

RENDERING AND PAYMENT OF BILLS

A. Meter Reading and Billing
1. General

Regular bills shall be rendered at intervals of one month or multiples thereof, as may be established from time to time by the
Board or by ordinance. Except as provided in A.4 of this Rule, and in the water or electric rate ordinance, bills for water or
electric service will be based upon delivery as indicated by the Department's meter. Insofar as is practicable, meters will be
read at regular intervals for the preparation of regular bills, and meters will be read as required for the preparation of
opening, closing, and special bills.

Except as otherwise specifically provided for in schedules of the rate ordinance or unless an agreement under A.4 of this
Rule is in effect, if for any reason service is unmetered or the meter is in a locked compartment or otherwise cannot be read
or fails to register correctly, water consumption and/or energy use may be estimated by the Department based on the
following:

a. Previous consumption by Metered Service to the Premises; or

b. The average consumption for the corresponding billing periods during which the meter is known to have registered
correctly; or

c. The consumption as registered by a substitute meter; or

d. By giving consideration to the nature of use, volume of business, seasonal demand and any other factors that may assist
in determining such consumption.

2. Proration of Bills

Rate schedules stated on a monthly basis are related to a 30-day consumption interval as a standard month. Whenever actual meter
read intervals differ from a standard 30-day period or multiples thereof, bills related thereto, computed from monthly schedules, are
subject to proration on a 30-day basis.

However, at the discretion of the Department, in computing and rendering regular bills, minor variances between actual read
intervals and any established regular read interval need not be considered, in accordance with the following:

a. Where bills are regularly rendered monthly, computation from monthly rate schedules may be made directly whenever
actual read intervals are not more than five days greater or not more than five days lesser than the standard 30-day interval.

b. Where bills are regularly rendered bi-monthly, computation from monthly rate schedules may be made on the basis of
multiples of two (except as to electrical demand) of the stated rate schedules whenever actual read intervals are not more
than eight days greater or not more than six days lesser than the standard 60-day interval.

Charges for metered or unmetered services may be calculated on a daily, monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annual
basis. Whenever a change of the charges under a rate schedule becomes effective, bills shall be prorated with respect to the

effective date of the change.

If a time-of-use meter is installed, bills shall not be prorated. Whenever possible, the change to a time-of-use rate schedule shall be
effective for the entire billing period during which the time-of-use meter recorded an entire billing period of consumption.

24


=== PAGE 27 ===
3. When Readings of Separate Meters May be Combined

For the purpose of computing charges, each meter upon the Customer's Premises will be considered separately, and readings
of two or more meters will not be combined as equivalent to measurement through one meter, except when such
combination is for the convenience of the Department or is provided for by rate ordinance. When two or more water meters
are substituted for a single meter on the same Service Connection, the size of the service shall be substituted for the sizes of
the meters in billing under the applicable rate schedule.

4. Agreements for Billing on an Estimated Basis

The Department may, at the discretion of the Board, enter into agreements with governmental agencies which provide that
billings to such agencies will be on an estimated basis, provided that an adjustment will be made at least annually or more
often to account for any difference between the estimated billings and that which the billings would have been had they
been based on applicable rates and actual meter registrations.

For purposes of this Rule, "governmental agencies" shall include the United States and its departments, agencies, and
bureaus, the State or any local government or any agency thereof, or public districts.

B. Application of Service Availability or Special Metering Charges

The Service Availability or Special Metering Charges specified in rate schedules shall apply to each direct service meter (as
distinguished from subordinate meters).

Direct service meters shall include those meters the readings of which are combined with readings of other meters as measurement
through one meter.

Subordinate meters are attachment metering devices, demand meters, power factor metering devices, totalizing devices, and
submeters.

C. Metering at Voltages Other Than Delivered Voltages

All new services shall be metered at delivery Voltage. When the service Voltage of an existing facility is changed, the metering
shall be changed to correspond with the new service Voltage. Installations which are not metered at delivery Voltage, in service on
January 1, 1982, may continue to be metered at Voltage other than delivery Voltage until a change is made in delivery Voltage.

D. Payment of Bills

All bills are due and payable upon issuance, and payment shall be made at the offices of the Department in person, by electronic
transfer of funds, by mail, or at the Department's option, to duly authorized collectors of the Department. Bills are delinquent 19
days after the date of issuance or as prescribed by law, these Rules or ordinance.

Customers, owners, and/or operators of residential property served through Master Meter(s), who are unwilling or unable to pay for
such service, subject the property to assessment and/or lien for the cost of such unpaid service as provided for by law, these Rules
or ordinance, and thereafter, these costs shall be paid in the same manner as payment is made for other essential public service
furnished to and benefiting real property.

Bills for connection or reconnection of service and payments for deposits or to reinstate deposits as required under the Rules of the
Department shall be paid before service will be connected or reconnected.

If a deposit is required under these Rules and such deposit is not made, the Department may refuse or immediately discontinue
water and/or electric service to the Applicant or Customer.

25


=== PAGE 28 ===
. Notice of Bill Dispute Hearing Procedure

Notice of the bill dispute resolution hearing procedure provided for in Rule No. 10 titled "DISPUTES OF BILLS AND OTHER
DEPARTMENT PRACTICES" shall be provided to the Customer.

. Remittance Reversal Charge

Whenever a check is received by the Department in payment of billing for water or electric services, security deposits, or other
charges, and when negotiated, said check is not paid by the issuing bank, the Department will assess an additional charge consisting
of an amount to be determined from time to time by the General Manager.

. Late Payment Charge

Whenever payment of a regular bill for water or electric service is received after 5:00 p.m. of the date specified on the original bill,
a late payment charge, in an amount to be determined from time to time by the General Manager, may be assessed.

. Field Collection Charge

A Field Collection Charge, in an amount to be determined from time to time by the General Manager, will be assessed when a field
collector either leaves a disconnect notice or collects the delinquent bill.

Attorneys' Fees and Court Costs

In the event recourse to litigation is required against a Customer arising from nonpayment of charges for either electric service or
water service, as defined by these Rules, in addition to sums due and payable for water or electric service, the Customer shall be
liable to pay reasonable attorneys' fees, as well as all court costs incurred by the Department in the litigation, whether it proceeds to
judgment or not. The court shall, upon application by the City Attorney, assess reasonable attorneys' fees in an amount sufficient
for the City and its Department of Water and Power to recover its costs incurred in pursuing the litigation.

The City Attorney may waive all or a portion of such fees and costs, when, in the judgment of the City Attorney, the facts related to
nonpayment of charges for water service or electric service, reflect a reasonable dispute as to the amount and basis of such charges.

Assessment Lien Processing Fees

In the event that an assessment and/or lien filing is required against property arising from nonpayment of charges for either master-
metered residential electric or water service, in addition to sums due and payable, the property owner shall be liable to pay
reasonable costs incurred by the County or City or any of its departments for this action as required by Rule No. 23 titled "LIEN-
MASTER-METERED-RESIDENTIAL REAL PROPERTY."

RULE NO. 10

DISPUTES OF BILLS AND OTHER DEPARTMENT PRACTICES

Whenever the correctness of any bill, or part thereof, for water or electric service or in cases where the correctness of other
charges or practices of the Department is disputed by the Customer, the Department shall, upon request, conduct an investigation. This
investigation shall determine if an adjustment is warranted. Bill adjustments for meter errors shall be made pursuant to Rule No. 17
titled "METER TESTS AND ADJUSTMENTS OF BILLS FOR METER AND UTILITY ERRORS."

The Department's bill is due and payable upon issuance and is
delinquent if it remains unpaid 19 days after issuance. In order for a Customer to preserve the right to a dispute determination before
termination of service, the request for a dispute determination must be filed in writing with the Customer Relations Office within the
19-day period, and all undisputed amounts must be paid at the same time. The request for dispute determination will be resolved by the
Department within 30 days for multifamily master-metered residential services and within 60 days for all other services by referral to
an appropriate Department manager empowered to resolve the dispute.

Requests for dispute determination which are not filed in a timely manner, not in writing, or not accompanied by the
undisputed amount of the bill, will be investigated but will not guarantee the stoppage of delinquent processing, including termination
of service.

If a Customer disputes the correctness of any bill, or part thereof, for electric service and consequently requests a rereading of
the electric meter to be performed and such rereading would be outside the Department’s standard electric meter reading schedule for
that Customer, the Customer will be required to pay an amount as determined by the General Manager to cover the cost of this electric
meter rereading unless the electric meter rereading indicates that the Department’s prior electric meter reading was incorrect.

In cases where facts, not subject to exact determination, must be
decided in order to determine the application of rate schedules, General Provisions of the Water or Electric Rate Ordinances, or other
provisions of these Rules, the Rates Manager shall establish such facts and shall authorize billing adjustments to be made.

If after determination by the appropriate authority that all or a portion of the disputed amounts are due and the Customer
disputes the findings, then the Customer may, within 10 days, and upon further written request, accompanied with payment of the
entire outstanding bill, be granted a hearing before Department Management pursuant to the provisions of the Department’s then
current Disputed Bill Procedure.

Any payment that is not made as prescribed by this Rule will terminate the Customer's right to a dispute resolution and will
subject the service to termination or other methods of securing the payment in accordance with law, or these Rules or ordinance.

Customers will be informed of the investigation, disputed bill procedure, and other Department practices required by this
Rule by a statement on the bill or by other appropriate prescribed methods.

RULE NO. 11

DISCONTINUANCE AND RESTORATION OF SERVICE

A. Discontinuance of Water and/or Electric Service at Customer Request

Each Customer who intends to discontinue responsibility for payment for water and/or electric service shall notify the Department
specifying the date discontinuance is desired. Normally service may be discontinued on any regular working day if the Department
receives advance notice of not less than one working day from the Customer. The Customer will be held responsible for payment
for service furnished until one working day after the Department receives the Customer's notice or until the day specified in such
notice, whichever is later.

B. Discontinuance of Water and/or Electric Service by Department

1.

Nonpayment of Bills

A Customer's service may be discontinued for nonpayment of a bill for service rendered if said bill has not been paid within
19 calendar days after presentation as prescribed by ordinance, and a written notice of termination is thereafter first sent,
except when specifically prohibited by law, or these Rules or ordinance.

A Customer's service at a subsequent location may be discontinued for the nonpayment of a delinquent bill rendered for
service at a previous location served by the Department.

If a Customer is receiving service at more than one location, service at any or all locations may be discontinued if bills for
service at any one or more locations are not paid within the time specified above, provided, however, residential service
shall not be discontinued because of nonpayment of bills for nonresidential service.

In the event a Customer is a resident of a dwelling unit under the jurisdiction of the Housing Authority of the City of Los
Angeles and becomes delinquent in the payment of their electric bill, the Department shall notify such Authority and the
County of Los Angeles Department of Social Services not less than seven (7) calendar days prior to the discontinuance of
electric service to such Customer. The Customer is deemed to have authorized and consented to the Department providing
such notice to these public agencies.

Noncompliance with Court Judgment

In addition to any other remedies available for nonpayment, when a judgment has been obtained from a court of competent
jurisdiction for nonpayment of charges for either water or electric service and judgment is not satisfied within 30 days, with
such interest as is allowed by law, the Department may terminate all service to the Customer against whom such judgment
was obtained at any location where the Customer is served, whether water or electric service, or both. In the event collection
of the judgment is deferred under a payment plan approved by the Department, the Customer shall be considered to have
one combined account for service, no matter how many Service Connections used. Failure to keep the combined account
current by (i) not making the specified payments under the plan and (ii) not paying all charges for current service, shall
permit the Department to terminate all service at any location where the Customer is served, whether water or electric
service, or both.

Noncompliance with the Department's Rules
If a Customer fails to comply with any of the Department's Rules, the Department will advise the Customer of such failure

in the manner prescribed in Rule No. 8 titled "NOTICES." After giving such notice, the Department may discontinue
service to the Customer if the Customer fails to comply within the time specified in the notice.

28


=== PAGE 31 ===
4. Conditions Unsafe or Damaging to the Department or its Customers

If an unsafe or hazardous condition is found to exist on the Customer's Premises, or if the use of water or electricity by
apparatus, appliances or other equipment is found to be unsafe or damaging to the Department or its Customers, service may
be refused or discontinued without notice. The Department will notify the Customer of the reasons for the refusal,
discontinuance or potential discontinuance and of the corrective action to be taken by the Customer.

Unsafe or hazardous conditions include, but are not limited to the presence of primary lines above swimming pools and/or
spas, and faulty Customer provided substructures and facilities. A Customer shall not construct, maintain, permit, or allow
any unsafe or hazardous condition, including but not limited to swimming pools and/or spas under the Department's primary
lines or in the distribution easement, and faulty Customer provided substructures and facilities.

New and/or existing legally permitted dwellings or a part thereof, including but not limited to accessory dwelling units
(ADU) located under the Department's primary lines or in the distribution easement, are allowed and are not considered to
be unsafe or hazardous conditions for purposes of this Rule provided such dwellings comply with prevailing CPUC General
Order 95 clearance standards, as they may be amended from time to time, and are not located within an LADWP easement
where the deed or easement document explicitly prohibits structures within the easement.

The Customer shall be wholly responsible to pay all the Department's costs to ensure any new and/or existing dwelling or
improvement meets prevailing GO 95 requirements, as they may be amended from time to time, or eliminate any unsafe or
hazardous conditions including, but not limited to, line relocation costs and safety or reliability related mitigation of faulty
Customer provided substructures and facilities. In no event shall a pole higher than 55 feet be installed along a residential
property line in order to accommodate any structure.
Failure of the Customer to pay the Department's demand for payment to ensure any new and/or existing dwelling or
improvement eliminates any unsafe or hazardous conditions, meets prevailing GO 95 requirements, or complies with any
conditions explicitly set forth in the Department's distribution easement documents shall be deemed a failure to comply with
these Rules and shall be a basis for refusal or discontinuance of service to the Customer.

5. Misrepresentation, Fraud, Theft, Damage, or Abuse

The Department may refuse to serve any Premises or discontinue any service at any time if necessary in order to protect the
Department against misrepresentation, fraud, theft, damage, and/or abuse of its equipment.

6. Inspection of Customer's Facilities

The Department does not assume the duty of inspecting the Customer's lines, pipes, appliances or apparatus, or any part
thereof, nor assume any liability therefore.

7. Notification of Apparent Defects

In the event that the Customer reasonably believes the service to be defective, and it appears that the defect may be due to
service from the Department, the Customer should immediately notify the Department to that effect.

8. Master-metered residential service is deemed to be an essential public utility and may not be discontinued except at the
direction of the General Manager and Chief Engineer and in accordance with law, or these Rules or ordinance.

C. Unmetered Services
1. Unapproved unmetered water and/or electric services

Unmetered Services installed without prior Department approval shall be subject to immediate discontinuance and no notice
shall be required.

of the applicable rate ordinance, the Department may charge and collect, in addition to other amounts due, a charge per
meter, in an amount as determined from time to time by the General Manager for restoration of service. In the event the
Customer restores the service or allows or causes it to be restored after it has been discontinued, for either reason, the
Department may again discontinue the service, and may charge and collect the Service Restoration Charge per meter. In
addition, for any further unauthorized restoration of service, the Department may collect appropriate charges to cover
investigation expenses, expenses incurred in discontinuing and restoring the service, and any other amounts due the
Department before service was discontinued.

If the Customer restores the service or allows or causes it to be restored after it has been discontinued because of a condition
as described in B.4 of this Rule, the Department may remove the meter and/or the service and not reinstall it until such
condition is corrected. The Department may collect appropriate charges to cover expenses incurred in investigation and
discontinuation and restoration of the service.

E. Theft of Water and/or Electricity

stop such theft and to gain restitution of amounts estimated to be the value of such theft including termination of service, filing of
criminal charges, and/or civil action.

In addition, the Department may collect appropriate charges to cover investigation expenses, expenses incurred in discontinuing
and restoring the service and any other amounts due the Department before service was discontinued.

The following charges for Main Extensions shall be paid in addition to all other applicable charges under the Rules of the
Department including but not limited to charges for Service Connections, meter installation, or acreage supply charge, and any
other charges.

1.

Service from Existing Mains

Every Applicant for a Service Connection or for water service from the main then existing or to be provided, whether
constructed with funds of the Department or advances from other Customers shall, unless the equivalent thereof has
otherwise been paid with respect to the Premises to be served, pay per foot of such Premises on the street in which the main
is located one-half of the current cost per lineal foot of the main of a size determined by the Department to be adequate to
serve the Premises.

Up to a maximum of 60 feet of paid water main charges for each existing Service Connection shall be credited to Premises,
under own ownership, on which one or more water Service Connections exist.

Water main charges applicable to Premises under one ownership, having water main frontages on more than one street, shall
be one-half the total frontages due, less credit for any existing water Service Connection(s).

a. Public Beautification Projects

Individual written applications for deferral of water main charges applicable to a Premises where a public beautification
project has been proposed may be presented to the Board of Water and Power Commissioners for consideration,
provided each of the following conditions have been satisfied:

(1) For the purposes of this Rule, a public beautification project is a project which substantially improves either the
physical environment or the aesthetics of the City or a well-recognized and defined neighborhood thereof and
which project will inure to the benefit of the public generally. Properties, including parks and playgrounds owned
by the City and under the control of the Department of Recreation and Parks, do not qualify.

(a) There is an existing water distribution main which is adequate to serve the project and no additional capital
investment is required.

(b) The project is located on a publicly owned right-of-way or on other property which for the life of the proposed
beautification project will be open to the public.

(c) The beautification project is of general public benefit to the City.

(d) The project proponent is a public agency, a public service organization or an established community
organization acceptable to the Department as a water service Customer.

(e) The water service Customer of record and the project proponent are one and the same.

40


=== PAGE 43 ===
(f) At such time as the beautification project terminates or ceases to exist, for any reason, the deferred water main
charges shall become fully due and payable.

(g) Water service to the Premises of a beautification project upon which charges are deferred under this Rule shall
be limited to that reasonably necessary to support the beautification project and may not be used for other uses
on the Premises.

(2) At such time as water service is requested for uses on the Premises other than directly for the beautification project,
all charges shall be due and payable.

(3) Only those applications meeting all of the above requirements and where the Board finds there is a reasonable
probability that the public beautification project will not proceed without a waiver, due to a lack of financial
resources by the project proponent, will be considered.

(4) The Board retains complete discretion to approve or disapprove any proposed application.

2. Extensions from Existing Mains
a. Advanced Payment

The Applicant shall advance the total cost of an extension to the nearest property line of the property to be served in
addition to any amount due under subsection B.1 of this Rule.

b. Refunds

Refunds without interest of monies collected under subsection B.2.a of this Rule will be made to Applicant or
Applicant's assigns at the rate of one-half of the amount advanced per lineal foot of main, per front foot of the property
of each additional Customer subject to the charge under subsection B.1 of this Rule, who is served from the extension
within ten (10) years from the date the advance is made by Applicant. The total amount of refund shall not exceed the
amount advanced.

c. Exclusion from Measurements

Frontages of Premises entitled to service from the main to be extended shall be excluded from the measurements for any
extension.

C. Acreage Supply Charge Districts

An acreage supply charge district shall be established when conditions of topography or elevation are such as to require expenditure
for facilities in addition to those which would be installed for extension of the Gravity System grid or network of Distribution
System facilities according to normal Gravity System standards, in order to provide pressures and supply which are determined
adequate by the Department in an area not heretofore served, or to permit serving additional Customers in an area already served.
The Chief Engineer of Water Works shall determine the additional facilities required, the cost thereof, and the boundaries of the
area to be served by them. The area within such boundaries shall be designated an Acreage Supply Charge District. Where
conditions warrant, the Chief Engineer of Water Works may establish a Gravity System Acreage Supply Charge District. The
additional cost of the District supply system as compared with normal Gravity System development, including pumping facilities,
supply mains, regulators, storage facilities, up to the full cost of any extension from the nearest main of adequate size to the District
supply system, and any other facilities shall be used as the basis for establishment of a District Acreage Supply Charge Rate by the
Chief Engineer of Water Works so as to spread such added costs to each Applicant for service within the District in the ratio that
the gross area of Applicant's property within an Acreage Supply Charge District bears to the District Net Area.

The Chief Engineer of Water Works shall maintain and have available for inspection with respect to each Acreage Supply Charge
District: (1) a map showing the boundaries of the District; (2) itemized estimates showing the current cost of the District supply
facilities and the development of the Acreage Supply Charge Rate; (3) the administrative Rules of the Department with respect to
Acreage Supply Charge District facilities, including connections for service thereto, application of charges, information to be
furnished by Applicants and related matters.

=== PAGE 44 ===
Charges

Except as hereinafter provided, Applicants for extension of distribution facilities within an Acreage Supply Charge District
or for a new service, other than Irrigation Service and Temporary Service, from the District supply facilities shall pay the
applicable Acreage Supply Charge in addition to all other applicable charges provided by these Rules including Main
Extension charges under subsection B of this Rule and the additional cost of any special facilities required to meet the water
needs of the Applicant which are in excess of those for which the District Supply System is designed.

a. Payment of Charges on a Portion of Property

(1) The Department may permit an Applicant to pay the District Acreage Supply Charge on a portion of the Applicant's
contiguous property, provided the remaining portion is comparable in character and topography and can be
developed in a manner similar to the parcel for which the District Acreage Supply Charge is to be paid.

(2) When it appears to the Chief Engineer of Water Works that the ownership of property within the District has been
divided in such a manner as to avoid payment of Acreage Supply Charges on land not to be served, the Department
shall have the right to compute and apply a new District Acreage Supply Charge Rate which shall be based on the
area which may be served within the District instead of the net area of the entire district.

b. Application of Charges
(1) New Service

An Applicant for any new service, other than temporary or irrigation, from the District Water System shall pay the
District Acreage Supply Charge, except as hereinafter provided.

An Applicant for service in an area where the ultimate system is not available may take service from the existing
system upon payment of applicable charges for that system and execution of an agreement to pay the charges in
effect for the ultimate system when it becomes available.

(2) Relocation of Existing Service

An Applicant for the relocation of an existing service from another district to a District main shall pay the currently
applicable District Acreage Supply Charge less any previous Acreage Supply Charge collected.

(3) Irrigation Service

Customers being served by Irrigation Service are required to pay the Acreage Supply Charge upon application for a
change to any other type of District service before the change is approved.

(4) Property Deferred from Acreage Supply Charge

(a) Property within the District that was served prior to the establishment of the District by a system which
became a part of the District system, may be deferred from the District Acreage Supply Charge if: (i) there is
no increase in the property area for which service was initially granted; and, (ii) there are no Service
Connections added to the property.

(b) Property that is being served by an existing main which is part of another system shall be deferred from the
Acreage Supply Charge if: (i) the Department uses the existing main to supply District water service; or, (ii)
the Department installs a new main to supply District water service and abandons the existing main.

(c) When property on which Acreage Supply Charges has been deferred is subdivided, that portion of the property

to which the water is mainly served or containing the principal building or dwelling shall continue to be
deferred and the remaining area shall be subject to the District Acreage Supply Charge.

42


=== PAGE 45 ===
(5) Advance Payments

(a) Where the cost of the supply facilities planned for an Acreage Supply Charge District which are necessary to
serve to and through an Applicant's property less the credit allowed for normal distribution main installation in
streets along the supply main is greater than the Applicant's Acreage Supply Charge, the Applicant shall be
required to advance the difference. Such advance payments shall be in addition to any payments otherwise
required by these Rules.

(b) Advance payments of the Acreage Supply Charge by an Applicant will be subject to refund without interest
during a period of ten years from the date of advance payment. Such refunds shall be made from payments
collected as Acreage Supply Charges within a refund area designated by the Department at the time the
advance is made. If a refund area includes any area where further District supply facilities are required, no
refund shall be made until financing of District supply facilities in that area has been completed. The total
amount of refunds to an Applicant shall not exceed the amount advanced by Applicant.

(6) Municipal Improvement Districts within Acreage Supply Charge Districts

Property within Municipal Improvement Districts shall be subject to the applicable Acreage Supply Charge less a
credit for the cost of water facilities provided through the applicable Municipal Improvement District. The amount
of such credit shall be determined on a per acre basis by dividing the cost of such water facilities by the gross area
within the applicable Municipal Improvement District.

D. Water Facilities Installed Under Private Contract

1.

An Applicant for service requiring Main Extensions is required to design and install or arrange for such extensions and
Service Connections to be designed and installed by the Applicant under private contract. Such facilities must be designed

furnish permanent electric service to Applicants, which will be made in accordance with the following provisions:

H. General
1. Distribution Line Extension Basis

a. Design. The Department will be responsible for planning, designing, and engineering Distribution Line Extensions using
the Department’s standards for material, design, and construction.

b. Ownership. The Distribution Line Extension facilities installed under the provisions of this Rule shall be owned,
operated, and maintained by the Department. The Customer shall own, operate and maintain the Conduits,
Substructures, and Protective Structures of line extensions located on private property, except as in part 2.a.(2) below.

c. Private Lines. The Department shall not be required to serve any Applicant from Distribution Line Extension facilities
that are not owned, operated, and maintained by the Department.

2. Distribution Line Extension Locations
a. Rights of Way:
The Department will own, operate and maintain Distribution Line Extension facilities only:

(1) along public streets, alleys, roads, highways and other publicly dedicated ways and places which the Department
has the legal right to occupy, and

(2) on public lands and private property across which the Department may obtain right-of-way and permits satisfactory
to the Department without cost or condemnation.

b. Normal Route of Line

The length and normal route of a Distribution Line Extension will be determined by the Department and considered as
the distance along the shortest, most practical, available, and acceptable route, which is clear of obstructions from the
Department's nearest permanent and available distribution facility to the point from which the Service Facilities will be
connected.

c. Alternative Routes

Where applicable laws or regulations prevent the utilization of what otherwise would be the shortest practicable route
for a line extension for the purpose of delivering electric service to the Applicant, the Applicant shall, subject to the
provisions of this Rule, provide the Department an alternative longer right-of-way satisfactory to the Department and
pay the incremental cost of the longer route. If the Applicant chooses to request underground delivery over what would
otherwise be the shortest practicable overhead route, the Department may, where feasible, provide such underground
delivery in accordance with the underground extensions provisions of this Rule.

d. Special Facilities
Under this Rule, the Department will install only those facilities which the Assistant General Manager - Power deems
are necessary to extend its permanent Distribution System to points from which Service Connections may be made in

accordance with the Department's Rules and rate schedules. Where the Applicant requests facilities in addition to, or in
substitution for, the standard distribution facilities the Department normally would install, as determined by the

46


=== PAGE 49 ===
Assistant General Manager - Power, the extra cost thereof shall be paid by the Applicant if the Department agrees to
install such facilities.

Underground Distribution Line Extensions

a. Underground Required
Underground Distribution Line Extensions shall be installed where required to comply with applicable laws and
ordinances or similar requirements of governmental authorities having jurisdiction and where the Department maintains
or desires to maintain underground distribution facilities.

b. Underground Optional.

When requested by Applicant and agreed upon by the Department, underground Distribution Line Extensions may be
installed in areas where not required, as provided in Section H.3.a.

Underground Designated Areas

In areas where the Department maintains or desires to maintain underground distribution facilities for its operating
convenience, these areas may be designated for underground distribution and that portion of the Conduit system located
on public property will be furnished, installed, and maintained by the Department at its expense except that
modifications to the Conduit system on public property required to provide or upgrade service to an Applicant or group
of Applicants will be made subject to provisions prescribed by this Rule.

Overhead Distribution Line Extensions

Overhead Distribution Line Extensions may be installed only where underground extensions are not required as provided in
Section H.3.a.

Temporary Service

Facilities installed for Temporary Service or for operations of speculative character or questionable permanency shall be
made in accordance with the fundamental installation and ownership provisions of this Rule, except that all charges and
refunds shall be made under the provisions of Rule No. 13, Temporary Service.

Services

Service Facilities connected to the Distribution Lines to serve an Applicant's Premises will be installed, owned and
maintained as provided in Rule No. 16 L, Service Connections.

Conversions of Overhead to Underground

The replacement of existing overhead Distribution Lines with underground Distribution Lines will be made in accordance
with Rule No. 20, Replacement of Overhead With Underground Electric Facilities.

I. Installation Responsibilities

1.

2.

Underground Distribution Line Extensions

Conduit and structures for underground extensions in public property will be installed by the Department at the Customer's
expense. The Customer shall pay an amount equal to the Department's actual cost for such Conduit and structures required
to provide the Customer's electric service. Total actual costs, as calculated by the Department, will be shared among all
identified customers, present and future, that will benefit from such Conduit and structures, as well as with the Department
if the Department reserves some of the Conduit and structures for its own needs. For Conduit and structures that are
required for the exclusive use by a Customer, with no identified benefit to future customers or the Department, the
Customer will be responsible for 100 percent of the actual costs. The Customer shall pay its share of the estimated cost prior
to any work being undertaken by the Department. However, the Department shall bear the Customer's share of costs for
Conduit and structures for underground extensions in public property for any project that is designated by the Mayor's office
as a 100 percent affordable or supportive housing project and newly submitted during the existence of a local emergency
due to homelessness declared by the Mayor.

Where mutually agreed upon by the Department and the Applicant, the Conduit and related structures for an underground
extension may be installed by the Applicant in accordance with the Department's design, specifications, and requirements.
Installation shall not commence until the Department provides the design, specifications, and requirements to the Customer.
Upon acceptance by the Department, ownership of such facilities shall be deemed transferred to the Department.

When an Applicant elects to have the underground extension work in public property performed by a third-party contractor,
the Department will reimburse the Applicant for the costs applicable to the identified customers, present and future, that will
benefit from the underground line extension in public property and the costs applicable to the Department if the Department
reserves some of the Conduit and structures for its own needs. These identified customers, present and future, in turn will
pay the Department for their share of the actual costs once new or upgraded electric services are requested. Aside from the
underground line extension itself, subject to advance approval by the Department, the Applicant will receive credit for off-
site or extra facilities for future system needs installed by the Applicant's contractor which are not reasonably related to the
Applicant's electric service. All credits will be based on the Department's estimate of standard costs and will be applied after
the facilities are accepted. Credits will be deducted from the Department's charges for the project, and any remaining credit
will be reimbursed by the Department to the Applicant.

No reimbursements will be made in excess of Applicant's actual cost less any allowances and/or later than 12 months after
the Department's inspection completion and acceptance of the installed facilities.

Cable in underground extensions in public property will be installed, owned, and maintained by the Department provided
the Applicant pays in advance a nonrefundable sum equal to the estimated difference between the cost of the Cable
extension and the allowance calculated under Section J below.

Overhead Distribution Line Extensions
The Department is responsible for furnishing and installing all facilities required for the Distribution Pole Line Extension

provided the Applicant pays in advance a nonrefundable sum equal to the estimated difference between the cost of the
extension and the allowance calculated under Section J below.

J. Distribution Line Extension Allowances

Refundable amounts contributed or Advanced under conditions of a Rule previously in effect will be refunded in accordance
with the provisions of such earlier Rule.

9. Joint Applicants
When two (2) or more parties make joint contributions or Advances on the same Distribution Line Extension, refunds will
be distributed to parties in the same proportion as their individual contributions or Advances bear to the total refundable
amount, or as they mutually agree in writing

10. Series of Distribution Line Extensions
Where there is a series of Distribution Line Extensions, commencing with a Distribution Line Extension having an
outstanding amount subject to refund, and each Distribution Line Extension is dependent on the previous Distribution Line

Extension as a direct source of supply, a series refund will be made as follows:

a. Additional Service Connections supplied from a Distribution Line Extension on which there is a refundable amount will
provide refunds first to the Distribution Line Extension to which they are connected; and

b. When the amount subject to refund on a Distribution Line Extension in a series is fully refunded, the excess refundable
amount will provide refunds to the Distribution Line Extension having the oldest outstanding amount subject to refund
in the series.

M. Overhead Distribution Line Extensions for Subdivisions or Developments

RULE NO. 17

METER TESTS AND ADJUSTMENT OF BILLS FOR
METER AND UTILITY ERRORS

A. Meter Tests

1.

Every meter will be tested at or prior to the time of installation. No water meter will be placed in service which fails to
register within test flow limits required by Department specifications. No electric meter will be placed in service if found to
register less than 99 percent or more than 101 percent of the true value.

When a Customer questions the accuracy of a water or electric meter, the Department will conduct an official test of the
meter within a reasonable time after the Customer's request.

If the requested test is made within 12 months of a previously requested and performed test on the same meter, the
Customer will be required to pay an amount as determined by the General Manager to cover the cost of the test. If the meter
is found to register less than 98 percent or more than 102 percent of the true value, the charge for the test will be waived.

The Customer has the right to be present or represented at the duly scheduled time for the test. The test will be scheduled
during regular working hours of the Department and conducted whether or not the Customer or representative of the
Customer appears as scheduled for the test.

B. Meter Errors

1.

When, as a result of any test, a meter is found to register more than 102 percent of the true value, the Department will refund
or credit to the Customer the overcharge based on meter readings corrected to the true value, for the period in which the
meter was in use, not to exceed 12 months, unless it can be shown that the error was due to some particular cause, the date
of which can be fixed, provided that the period of adjustment shall not exceed three years in any event.

When, as a result of any test, a meter is found to register less than 98 percent of the true value, the Department may render a
bill based on meter readings corrected to the true value, for water or electricity consumed but not covered by bills previously
rendered for a period not to exceed four months, provided that if the actual period in which the error in registration existed
exceeded four months, and can be definitely determined, the correction to be made may cover the actual period, provided
that the period of adjustment shall not exceed three years in any event.

C. Utility Errors

1.

When a Department error in billing is discovered on a current Customer's account and the date of its occurrence can be
determined, the overcharge or undercharge will be computed back to but not beyond that date, but not in any event
exceeding four years prior to the date of discovery of the overcharge or undercharge.

When a utility error extends back into a prior Customer's billing period:

a. Paragraph C.1 of this Rule shall apply when overcharges have occurred. Prorated refunds will be mailed to the prior
Customer's current mailing address, or credited to the current account. If the prior Customer no longer has a Department
account, either an attempt to locate the prior Customer will be made or the refund will be mailed to the prior Customer's
last known mailing address.

b. In cases of undercharges, if a closing bill has been rendered, it will be canceled and a corrected closing bill will be
mailed to the prior Customer's last known mailing address. However, if the Department has not taken any action to
correct the error within four years of the date of discovery of such error, the Department will not attempt to collect the
balance due. If the account has not been closed by the payment of a closing bill, it shall be considered current and
paragraph C.1 of this Rule will apply.

70


=== PAGE 73 ===
D. Back-Billing
When the Department has failed to issue a bill to a Residential, Industrial or Commercial Customer, the Department will not back-
bill the customer for a period of time in excess of (1) 3 billing cycles for customers billed bi-monthly or (ii) 6 billing cycles for
customers billed monthly, from the date of the last regular read within the customer’s most recent billing cycle, unless otherwise
provided by law or contract.
The foregoing back-billing limitation is not applicable to: (1) “back-dated service connection”; (ii) energy theft; (iii) water theft; (iv)
illegal diversion; (v) fraud; (vi) customer refusing access; and (vii) all instances where delay or error in billing is solely attributable
to customer action or inaction which serves to impede LADWP’s ability to conduct its business.

includes multiple end users such as apartment, condominium or commercial units and allocated to the end users will not be
considered a resale under the City Charter, the applicable rate Ordinance or these Rules provided that all of the following
requirements, conditions, and restrictions are met:

In the event the water or energy is not submetered and a cost/use allocation methodology is employed by the Department’s
customer to divide the cost among users of the water or energy, the method used must fairly and equitably allocate to each
end user of water or energy the amount actually used by each end user and determine costs based on the actual use, all subject
to the following requirements:

The end users pay no more than if the Department provided the water or energy directly.

No additional costs, fees, services charges or expenses of any nature are added to the end users’ bills by the Department’s
customer or the customer’s agents, directly or indirectly, related to the allocation methodology including but not limited to
charges for establishing new accounts, meter reading charges, equipment charges, account charges or any charge related to
maintaining or operating the allocation system.

The Department’s customer shall provide the Department and all end users the cost allocation methodology and results of
that methodology as applied to each end user. In no event can the Department’s customer use a calculation or methodology
that results in the end user being charged for an amount greater than the actual consumption at the Department’s actual rates
charged to the Department’s customer.

The Department’s applicable water and/or electric rates shall be conspicuously posted in a public place on the premises.

The provisions of this Rule concerning cost allocations to end users shall not be construed as permitting or authorizing any
cost allocations to end users which is prohibited, restricted or regulated by any other applicable law, rule or regulation.

The Department shall have the right to require the customer to discontinue any cost allocation practice determined or known
to be in violation of this Rule, a City ordinance or the City Charter.

Pursuant to provisions of the Los Angeles City Charter allowing the sale of surplus water outside the Department’s service

area, this subsection D does not apply to public utilities or municipalities taking water from the Department for redistribution
to customers on their own systems.

RULE NO. 19

WATER CONSERVATION (RETROFIT ON RESALE) ORDINANCE EXEMPTIONS
A. Exemptions

The following are exemptions from Article II of Chapter XII of the Los Angeles Municipal Code provisions requiring installation
of ultra-low flush toilets (ULFT) upon residential property resale. Also, qualifying multi-family properties may be eligible to
receive an extension of time to comply with the requirement to install ULFTs.

1. Historical Buildings

Historical buildings as defined herein are exempted from the Ordinance requirement to install ULFTs. However, a toilet
tank displacement device or other toilet flush reduction device shall be installed.

For the purposes of this exemption, a historical building is defined as any building designated by the City of Los Angeles
as a Historic-Cultural Monument, on or determined eligible for the California Register of Historic Resources, or on or
determined eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. In addition, any buildings that are
contributing structures to National Register Historic Districts, or contributing structures to a City of Los Angeles Historic
Preservation Overlay Zone are exempt.

2. Bathrooms of Architectural Significance
In residential buildings where bathroom fixtures are integrated into a unique, defined architectural style, including some
original toilets specifically color-coded to unique ceramic tile, those toilets meeting the following requirements may be
eligible for an exemption from the Ordinance requirements:
a. The bathroom must be of a unique, defined style considered to have architectural or historical significance, and
b. The existing toilet must be an original fixture of the same age as the structure, and

c. A similarly styled replacement ULFT is not commercially available.

This exemption is not allowed for contemporary toilet fixtures that are simply color coordinated with ceramic tile. This
exemption is not allowed due to unusual expenses that may be incurred in the replacement of non-water conserving toilets.

3. Incompatible Plumbing Conditions

In rare instances where unusual plumbing conditions do not allow for installation of ULFTs, those properties are
exempted. This exemption is reserved for those rare instances where a documented plumbing design condition will not
allow installation of a ULFT. However, in those instances, a toilet tank reduction device or other toilet flush reduction
device shall be installed.

This exemption is reserved only for plumbing restrictions, and is not allowed due to required replacement of tile or other
floor coverings.

4. Multi-Family Residential Properties with more than 100 units

Multi-family residential properties of more than 100 units may receive additional time to comply with Ordinance provisions
pertaining to the installation of ULFTs upon resale. Both sellers and buyers of such properties may apply in writing to the
Water Conservation Coordinator and request permission to phase in replacement of ULFTs. The request for permission
shall include a proposed schedule of toilet installations to comply in a timely manner. The schedule shall reflect a sincere
effort to comply with the Ordinance’s provisions as quickly as possible. The Water Conservation Coordinator will review

74


=== PAGE 77 ===
each request and proposed schedule, and if approved, will authorize an extension of time after property resale to install all
ULFTs. In no instance, however, will any property owner, regardless of the number of housing units or toilets to be
replaced, be allowed an extension of more that one year from date of resale to install all ULFTs.

B. Surcharge Appeal Process

The Department of Water and Power may apply a surcharge to any customer who fails to comply with provisions of the City of Los
Angeles (City) Water Conservation Retrofit On Resale Ordinance. Any customer who feels that a surcharge was improperly
imposed may file an appeal in accordance with the following procedure.

1. Water Conservation Coordinator Review

The customer shall prepare a written request to the Water Conservation Coordinator, listing the property address in
question, the reasons the surcharge was improperly applied, and for what time period the appeal addresses. A separate
appeal must be submitted for each water account in question. The Water Conservation Coordinator will review the appeal,
discuss it with the customer, and may request additional information from the customer, such as plumbing receipts or other
records as evidence that conservation retrofit devices were installed according to the City’s Water Conservation Ordinance.
The Water Conservation Coordinator will make every attempt to utilize his authority to resolve the dispute. Following this
review, the Water Conservation Coordinator will make a determination in writing to the customer.

2. Second-Level Review

If the customer is not satisfied after this determination, the customer may request an appeal by the Customer Relations
Manager. The Customer Relations Manager and/or the Director of Customer Services will review the appeal, the Water
Conservation Coordinator’s findings, and will exercise their authority to resolve the dispute.

3. General Manager/Hearing Examiner Review

If management is unable to resolve the dispute, the customer may appeal in writing to the General Manager for a hearing to
review the second-level decision. A hearing will be held by the General Manager, a designee with the authority to act on his
behalf, or a Hearing Examiner appointed by the Department. The Hearing Examiner shall have the full power to act on
behalf of the General Manager in determining the resolution of the dispute. After conducting the hearing and reviewing
information presented by the customer and management, the presiding authority will render a decision, and the customer
will be notified of findings within 14 days of the hearing.

Any customer still not satisfied may appeal directly to the Board of Water and Power Commissioners.

the Applicant(s) or Applicants' representative on public property and/or Department easements; and

c. Made the necessary arrangements with all other utilities, agencies, City departments, or private companies having
ownership on or using the same pole line or having rights thereto, to remove, relocate, or replace all existing overhead
communication and electric distribution facilities.

3. The area to be underground includes both sides of the street for at least one block or 600 feet, whichever is the lesser. If, in
an industrially zoned area, any portion of the area to be underground is not presently being served by the Department and is
not committed to underground distribution by some means acceptable to the Department such as deed restrictions, the
Applicant(s) shall pay, in addition to the foregoing, the amount by which the estimated cost of completing the underground
system exceeds the estimated cost of an equivalent new overhead system, both such estimates being exclusive of
transformers, meters and services.

C. Conversion at Applicant(s) Expense
In circumstances where the area to be underground is less than one block or 600 feet, whichever is the lesser, and the conversion is
mutually agreed upon by the Department and the Applicant(s), overhead distribution facilities may be replaced with underground
distribution facilities provided the Applicant(s) requesting the change, in addition to the conditions outlined in subsections B.1 and

B.2 of this Rule, have met the following conditions:

1. Pay the Department its estimated cost of the unused life of the overhead system to be removed and its estimated net cost
(cost of removal less salvage) of the removal; and

2. Pay the Department the excess, if any, of its estimated cost of completing the underground system and its estimated cost of
installing a new equivalent overhead system.

The General Manager is authorized and directed to determine, from time to time, the amount of the charge for the services,
materials, costs, penalties, other charges, deposits and interest rates to be established pursuant to these Rules in order to enable the
Department to recover the costs it incurs, including indirect costs, in providing services, materials, or work.

Said charges are to be determined by the General Manager based on the actual cost, including indirect cost, to the Department
of providing the services, material or work, and provided further that such charges may be based on an average, over a given period of
time, not to exceed one year, of the cost experienced by the Department for similar services, materials, and work, considering the size
and type of facility to be installed or changed and according to the condition of installation or change.

Determination of said charges may be designated by the Chief Operating Officer of Power for Schedule E, the Chief
operating Officer of Water for Schedule W, and the Director of Customer Service for Schedule C if such authority is approved by the
General Manager. Charges shall be updated annually, submitted to the Board of Water and Power Commissioners and posted on the
Department’s website http://www.ladwp.com.

The charge currently effective at the time of completion of any facility, installation, or change shall apply. If actual current
costs exceed any amounts deposited in advance, the difference shall be billed to and paid by the Applicant. If actual current costs do not
equal or exceed the amount deposited in advance, the difference shall be refunded to the Applicant; provided that any increase or
reduction in charges shall not be applicable if the facility, installation, or change is completed within one year of the date of deposit for
such charges. Where the Department has experienced any cost, including engineering or administrative costs, but the facilities and
installations are not completed or begun because of cancellation or abandonment of the plans, all such costs shall be deducted from
amounts deposited in advance before any refund is made to the Applicant.

Said charges as are in effect from time to time shall be deemed to be a part of the Rules of the Department then currently
effective as though fully set forth in said Rules.

Any implementation or revision of said charges shall first be approved by the Board of Water and Power Commissioners at

a regularly scheduled meeting pursuant to the applicable requirements of State law (currently Government Code Sections 66016 and
66018) concerning the adoption of fees and charges.
