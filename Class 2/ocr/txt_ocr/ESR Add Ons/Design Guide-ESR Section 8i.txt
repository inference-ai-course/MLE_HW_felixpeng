A. INTRODUCTION

1.

This section is intended to assist Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (Department) customers in
the design and evaluation of utility interconnections for customer-owned parallel-generation, backup and
energy storage systems.

The Solar Incentive process has been separated from the solar interconnection process. For more
information regarding available solar programs visit www.ladwp.com/solar.

The interconnection of customer-owned parallel-generation requires the following before any construction
may begin:

a. An Interconnection Agreement (IA): See TYPICAL TIME-LINES FOR PARALLEL-GENERATION
INSTALLATIONS, pages 1-16 and 1-17 for contact information and INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS,
page 8-3i for details.

b. A Generation Interconnection Study: For aggregate parallel energy source capacities greater than
30kW, depending on available electric system (grid) capacity and line loading, a generation
interconnection study shall be required to determine if the Department will need to install additional
protective equipment, perform system modifications or upgrades at the customer’s expense. The
typical timeline for the generation interconnection study is 2-4 weeks. If the proposed aggregate
parallel energy source is greater than the 15% of the peak line loading or 100% of the minimum line
loading, dependent on generation system topology, a supplemental study shall be performed. The
typical timeline for the supplemental study is 2-4 weeks. If the proposed generation system fails the
supplemental study a detailed study shall be required. The typical timeline for the detailed study is 4-6
weeks.

Note: An interconnection study may result in lower capacity limitations than the maximum limits
established in PROTECTIVE SCHEMES, page 8-7i. Regardless of the number of supply points,
these capacity limitations apply to the entire customer premises, see Glossary for definition of
Premises.

c. A Service Commitment: The Department will determine the method of interconnection and transmit
requirements to the customer in writing after appropriate engineering deposits and customer
submittals have been received by the Department. See DATA REQUIRED FOR DESIGN, page 8-2i.

B. DATA REQUIRED FOR DESIGN

1.

When considering the installation of a parallel-generation and/or storage facility, customers must contact
the Department as soon as possible so that:

a. The Department’s Service Planners can work with the customer to establish an acceptable
interconnection scheme for the customer’s facility.

b. Customers may avoid unnecessary expenses and delays in service caused by assuming deficient
interconnection schemes and equipment requirements.

At the time of initial contact, or as soon as possible, customers should provide the Department with the
following information so that the Department may assist the customer in finalizing the customer’s plans:

a. Electrical plans including load schedules, single-line diagrams, Service Planning Information form (see
pages 1-19 and 1-20), and Supplemental Battery Energy Storage System Data sheet (if applicable).

b. Plot and site development plans showing generator, AC disconnect, metering equipment locations and
Department access to generator, AC disconnect and meter equipment locations.

c. Energy source information:
(1) Maximum kilowatt rating
(2)
(3) Voltage regulation
(4)

Nominal voltage output

Maximum fault current contribution

B. DATA REQUIRED FOR DESIGN (Cont.)

3.

d. Protective system information:

(1) Protective system plan

(2) Manufacturer’s data sheets and maintenance requirements for protective equipment

(3) Any additional information required by the Department
Upon receiving the requested information and engineering fees, the Department will provide customer
requirements drawings and Department construction drawings as needed. Customer requirement
drawings provide the customer with the information necessary to construct the interconnection facilities for

the transformers, protective devices, meters and other necessary equipment that will be installed by the
Department.

C. ELECTRIC RATES

Rates for the sale or exchange of electrical energy between the Department and the customer shall be in
accordance with the established rates as specified in the effective Rate Ordinance(s) of the Department or by
contract.

D. INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS (IA)

1.

Customers are required to complete a Standard Offer Interconnection Agreement (Agreement) with the
Department before the generating and/or storage facility may be interconnected to the Department’s
electric system.

Customers seeking to interconnect a new Electrical Generation Facility associated with service according
to a Customer Generation (CG) rate shall be required to complete the Declaration of Ownership of
Electrical Generation Facility under a CG Rate form.

The Department normally uses a Standard Offer contract for Agreements. However, if the Standard Offer
is not suitable for the needs of the generating and/or storage facility, the customer may request the
Department to consider a separate nonstandard Agreement.

E. INTERCONNECTION COSTS

Customers are required to reimburse the Department for all expenses associated with completing the
interconnection of the customer’s parallel-generation facilities including, but not limited to, extensions or
modifications to the Department’s electric system and related facilities and construction costs.

F. TRANSFORMER REQUIREMENTS

1.

Energy sources rated less than 500kW may be connected on the secondary side of Department-owned
transformers supplied from the 4800-volt electric system.

Energy sources rated 500-750kW may be required to be connected on the secondary side of dedicated
Department-owned transformers supplied from the 34,500-volt electric system.

Energy sources rated over 750kKW shall be required to be connected on the secondary side of dedicated
Department-owned transformers supplied from the 34,500-volt electric system. Transformers shall be
sized to supply the complete installation and will serve no other customer. Secondary distribution may be
provided at the most convenient serving voltage for the customer.

Feed-In-Tariff (FiT) solar energy source(s) rated 1,000kKW and above may be connected to the secondary
side of Customer-owned transformers supplied from the 34,500-volt electric system. In these cases, the
generation meter shall be located between the Customer-owned transformer and Department-owned
system protection equipment. The metering equipment shall have a service class of 34,500-volts, Three-
Phase, Three-Wire. For additional information, see pages 4-21 through 4-36.

The Department may require that the Department-owned transformers used to supply the customer’s
electric system be sized (i.e., kVA rating) equal to, or greater than, the customer’s total generator capacity.

See TRANSFORMER INSTALLATIONS ON THE CUSTOMER’S PREMISES on page 1-33 for additional
information.

G. OPERATING REQUIREMENTS

1.

Customers are required to operate customer owned generating and storage facilities, whether permanent
or temporary, in accordance with the Agreement, The Department’s Electric Service Requirements, Rules,
Rate Schedules and all other applicable Codes and Ordinances.

Customers shall not:

a. Energize an un-energized electric line or transformer.

b. Reconnect the energy source after a protective device trip unless the customer’s electric system is
energized by the Department’s electric system by the Department, or unless the customer's electric
system is isolated from the Department’s electric system by the Department.

Note: Synchronous generators are capable of maintaining a distribution system energized even after the
line protective device has opened and separated (relayed) the line from the Department's electric
system. Since the Department uses automatic reclosing schemes to energize relayed lines after a
short time delay, customer-owned equipment or Department-owned equipment may be damaged if
power is restored to a line that is already energized by the customer’s generator(s).

These operating and protective requirements have been established to protect the health and well-being
of the public and utility workers from malfunctions in Department or customer equipment.

H. METERING

1.

4.

Customers shall provide Department approved metering arrangements for the installation of Department-
owned generation and generation performance (performance) meters to measure the energy into, or out of,
the installation at the interconnection point and at the energy source(s) output, respectively.

Exception: Provisions for a Department owned performance meter are no longer required for solar or
wind generating systems with an aggregate capacity of 30kW or less.

All metering equipment drawings must be submitted to, and approved by, the Department service planner
before the customer installs any equipment.

The performance meter as specified in these requirements is intended to measure the total output of the
customer’s generating system. No customer load is permitted on the generating system side of the meter.

Exception: Optional customer installed device(s) used to monitor system performance are permitted
and are subject to the following conditions:

(1) Device(s) shall be co-located on the same side of the AC disconnect switch as its source
of power.

(2) A device(s) power source wiring shall not bypass or defeat any AC disconnect switch.

(3) A device(s) power source and low voltage data circuits shall not enter or pass through any
utility sealed section.

(4) Total device load shall not exceed 100 Watts.
Whether the service connection is overhead or underground:

a. The line side (top of meter) of the Department Revenue meter used for billing shall be connected to
Department side, and the load side (bottom of meter) shall be connected to the customer side (the
generation contribution side).

b. The connections of the performance meter are opposite to those of the revenue meter. The generation
contribution side is connected to the line side (top of meter) and the Department side is connected to
the load side (bottom of meter). Refer to drawings on pages 8-16i to 8-34i.

H. METERING (Cont.)

c. The service class of the performance meter shall match the output of the generation source as
measured by one of the Department’s standard metering configurations. See page 2-5 for standard
meter configurations.

5. Feed in Tariff (FiT) Generation - Use of current transformers applies to transformer rated meter

installations. In this case, the current transformer polarities shall be facing the Department grid. For a self-
contained FiT meter, the delivery direction for purpose of metering shall be from the Department grid to the
line side (top of meter), and the customer’s FiT from the load side (bottom of meter). The Department
shall specify the class of service available for interconnection. See pages 8-17i (figure 3) and 8-18i (figure
4) for additional information.

Note: FiT generation taps shall not be made in any utility sealed section or compartment unless
approved by the Department.

6. Performance Meter Switchboard Review — Manufacturer’s switchboard drawings shall be submitted to
the Department when the performance meter (regardless of ampacity) and the utility disconnect are
integrated into a single switchgear unit, see pages 3-3 and 4-2, Manufacturer’s Drawings for Approval.

|. INSPECTIONS

The Department requires that all conditions specified by these requirements be met and verified by the
Department. In addition, an approval from the permitting agency for portions of the wiring and electrical
equipment under their jurisdiction is required before the Department will establish the interconnection.

J. LIABILITY

1.

Customers are responsible for damage caused to Department-owned equipment or other customers
served from the Department’s electric lines as a result of mis-operation or malfunction of the customer’s
energy source system.

The Department does not assume any responsibility for the protection of the customer’s energy source(s)
or any other portion of the customer’s electrical system. The customer is fully responsible for protecting the
customer's system so that faults or other disturbances on the Department’s system do not cause damage
to the customer’s equipment.

K. DISCONNECTION OF CUSTOMER’S ENERGY SOURCES

1.

GENERAL

In compliance with the Department’s Rules Governing Water and Electric Service, the Department reserves
the right to disconnect the customer’s energy source(s) from the Department’s electric system:

a. When the customer’s energy source is adversely affecting the Department’s electric system or other
customer's supplied from the Department’s electric system.

b. When the customer-installed protective system has been defeated or not properly maintained, (lack of
proper records is considered to be non-maintenance).

c. If the customer denies access to the Department to the generating facility or to required maintenance
and operating records.

d. Under emergency conditions as determined by the Department.

2. NOTIFICATION

a. Under non-emergency conditions, generally a notice of disconnection will be provided in writing as
follows:

(1) For energy sources with an aggregate capacity of less than 500kW, the Department will endeavor
to provide notification 72 hours in advance of the scheduled disconnection.

(2) For energy sources with an aggregate capacity of 500kW or greater, the Department will provide
notification 72 hours in advance of the scheduled disconnection.

K. DISCONNECTION OF CUSTOMER’S ENERGY SOURCES (Cont.)

b.

Under emergency conditions, the Department reserves the right to disconnect the customer’s energy
source(s) without notification.

If the customer-installed protective system becomes inoperative, the customer shall disconnect the
energy source(s) from the Department's electric system and immediately notify the Department. When
the protective system problems have been corrected, the customer shall request the Department for
permission to reconnect the customer generation system.

L. UTILITY DISCONNECTING MEANS
1. GENERAL

a.

Customers shall furnish, install and maintain circuit disconnect switches as required by State or
National Electric Code and the Department to isolate the customer's parallel generator, generating
and/or energy storage system from the Department's electric system. In general, a parallel generator
AC disconnect switch and a generator circuit disconnect switch will be required for all synchronous
generating systems, while only a parallel generator AC disconnect switch will be required for induction
and inverter-based parallel generating systems. In general, an additional AC disconnect switch shall
be required for energy storage.

Note: A parallel energy source AC disconnect switch shall not isolate a customer’s load panel.

The Department AC Disconnect Switch shall be a safety switch with a readily verifiable visual air gap to
assure positive circuit disconnect and shall be lockable in the open (off) position with a Department
standard padlock having a 5/16-inch lock shaft and a 1-inch locking clearance.

Note: A disconnect or circuit breaker with rack-out capability shall not be used to provide a
readily verifiable visual air gap.

AC disconnect switches shall have the line side of the disconnect switch, that is the fixed portion of the
switch connected to the Department’s power system. The load side of the switch, that is the movable
portion of the switch (the blades) shall be connected to the side of the customer’s parallel-generation
contribution. The blade side of the switch shall contain the fuse, and the fuse shall be “cold sequence”
so the fuse shall be de-energized from the utility source for safety.

Note: Safety switches shall have a viewing window to allow verification of the open switch condition
without exposing the Department’s personnel to energized bus. The viewing window shall be
located on center no higher than 68 inches above the level standing and working space.
Removing customer-owned fuses shall not be permitted as a means of providing an air gap.

Exception: Unless otherwise requested by the Department, a viewing window is not required for wall
mounted safety switches if a visual air gap may be verified by way of a hinged cover, the
potential is less than 600 volts, and where the maximum short-circuit at the AC disconnect
is 22,000 amperes or less.

Six or more AC disconnect switches connected to any single service point shall be approved
by a Department engineer and may be limited by the City of Los Angeles Department of Building and
Safety, or other Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ).

A dedicated AC utility disconnect may not be required for inverter-based PV systems with total
combined aggregate capacities up to and including 30 kW AC per premises. A dedicated AC utility
disconnect may not be required for inverter-based Battery Energy Storage Systems with total combined
capacities up to and including 30 kW AC per premises. This includes single-phase and three-phase
systems. For example, a 30kW photovoltaic system could be installed without a utility disconnect
switch at the same premises as a 30kW battery energy storage system without a utility disconnect
switch, provided:

(1) The service supply voltage is less than 600 Volts and,
(2) The service main disconnect controls all power flow registered by the meter and,

(3) Energy sources are not connected to the meter panel through a line side tap and,

class 320 or less and,

(5) The service consists of no more than six self-contained type meters per premises and,

(6) The service is not fed from the Department’s 34.5kV sub-transmission system.

Note: Services that are converted to the Department's 34.5kV sub-transmission system or exceed
the limits given above in the future shall require AC utility disconnects be installed for all
existing energy sources at the customer's expense.

Note: The Department may need to remove the revenue meter to disconnect the customer's
energy sources when required under section page 8-5i(K).

2. ACCESS

Switches used to disconnect the energy source shall be accessible under all conditions and at all times to
Department personnel. This may require disconnect switches to be located in a publicly accessible area or
be provided with an interlock system to gain access to an installation in a security-controlled area.

Exception: Parallel generating systems with an aggregated output capacity of 100kW or less per
property or premises as determined by the Department. In these cases, performance meters
and AC disconnect switches must be readily accessible and located on the exterior wall of a
building or other approved permanent structure, in an approved meter room on the ground
floor or first basement parking level or such other locations as the Department may designate.

M. SIGNS AND LABELS

1.

The customer shall provide and install the following signs as directed by the Department:

a. A sign at the main service (meter) panel location identifying each energy source AC disconnect
location.

b. A sign at each Department specified energy source AC disconnect identifying the main service

generation less than 600 kVA (480 kW) when supplied from the Department’s 34,500-volt electric
system.

c. Inverter-based generation and/or export capable storage with an aggregate capacity of less than
1,000kW when supplied from any Department electric system.

Note: The values given above are the absolute limits for each individual type of generation or export
capable storage per customer premises. Aggregation of different types may reduce the limits
above and require the installation of additional protective equipment. The specific protective
scheme required is subject to the Department’s available distribution system capacity, see page
8-2i note A.3.b. for generation integration study requirements.

The Department will install ground fault protection (GFP) equipment, at the customer's cost, for customer
generating and/or storage facilities with an aggregate capacity of 1,000kW or greater and interconnected
with the Department’s 34,500-volt electric system.

Note: The Department may require GFP for customer generation and/or storage facilities with an
aggregate capacity of less than 1,000kW and interconnected with the Department’s 34,500-volt
electric system when the facilities are located in remote areas or whenever such protection, in the
Department's judgment, is necessary.

The electrical rating (kW) of the customer’s generating and/or storage facility will determine, in part, the
configuration in operating characteristics and protection requirements for a customer’s interconnection
installation. Typical protection equipment requirements include, but are not limited to:

a. Under-voltage (Device 27) protection

b. Over-voltage (Device 59) protection

c. Under-frequency (Device 81U) protection

d. Over-frequency (Device 810) protection

e. Tripping batteries, circuit breakers and battery chargers

Note: See SPECIFICATIONS on page 8-9i for additional information.

Customer’s energy source circuit breakers must positively disconnect under all conditions. In most
instances this will require the installation of a charger assisted, uninterruptible DC power source.

The Department reserves the right to review and approve any interconnection scheme involving customer
initiation of the customer interconnecting breaker controls.

Protective equipment shall comply with IEEE1547-2018/2020a and be tested by the customer per
IEEE1547.1-2020 prior to commissioning. Test reports shall be provided to the Department upon request.

Protective equipment shall be readily accessible to the Department for periodic inspection.

For inverter-based (1,000kW to 10,000kW), synchronous (greater than 320kW), or induction (greater than
480kW) aggregate capacity parallel generating and/or storage systems, the Department will provide
additional protective equipment, at the customer's expense, including switchgear with a vacuum interrupter,
all necessary remote control, communication and protective devices (relays), batteries, and battery
charger. The customer shall provide and maintain a dedicated communication equipment, see
TELEMETRY. The customer shall also provide 120 volt single-phase control power to the protection
equipment, as specified by the Department.

a. Parallel-generation circuit connections may not be made in, or accessed through, any sealed utility
compartment.

Exception: Where metering equipment has been specifically designed and manufactured with a line
side tap terminating in a section that is accessible to the customer, and has been labeled
and certified by the manufacturer for the sole purpose of connecting parallel generating
systems.

b. Generation circuit conduits and conductors shall not be routed through any sealed utility compartment.

Note: sealed utility compartments include terminating pull boxes and pull sections, metering
compartments, and test-bypass compartments.

Caution: Existing service equipment may not have a suitable parallel-generation connection point on
the line side of the customer’s service over-current device and may require third party
certification of any proposed connection location. Consult with LADBS or other applicable
permitting agency regarding third party certification requirements.

Single-phase generation sources are limited to 30kW total capacity per premises unless dedicated on-site
transformation is provided. Installations with individual single-phase inverters greater than 30kW shall use
a three-phase interconnection system and balance the sources between the phases.

For synchronous generators, automatic synchronization is preferred. However, manual synchronization
with relay supervision is acceptable.

Synchronous generators designed to be started as induction motors may not require synchronizing relays,
but will not be permitted to start up if it results in detrimental effects to the Department’s electric system.

Voltage regulation equipment must be provided on the customer’s generator to maintain generation voltage
to within normal Department limits.

Induction generator installations may require capacitors to correct the power factor. Protection schemes
must be coordinated to ensure that the capacitors will always be disconnected before the induction
generator is disconnected.

Generator installations rated 750kW or less may be required by the Department to meet conditions and
specifications normally required for installations rated over 750kW. Safeguards that will be required and
the degree of sophistication will depend on the type of equipment and the interconnection scheme.

U. INVERTERS

Inverters may be used in customer generation systems that are interconnected with the Department’s Electric
system (grid). An inverter shall:

1.

Be permanently utility interactive at the point of interconnection to the grid.

Exception: Inverters may function in “off-grid” mode during a utility outage under the following
circumstances:

a. The inverter supplies power to an outlet on the inverter unit that is accessible only to qualified service
personnel per UL1741SA standards. Warning: Outlet circuit shall not be integrated with the buildings
internal wiring system.

b. The inverter supplies power to charge a battery backup system to feed critical loads (See section V).

Hybrid inverters may be used, provided that any additional “off-grid” AC outputs are never connected in
parallel with the Department’s grid.

PAGE 8-12i ELECTRIC SERVICE REQUIREMENTS LA DWP

Date: 05-01-24 DESIGN GUIDE FOR CUSTOMER-OWNED PARALLEL GENERATING SYSTEMS
U. INVERTERS (Cont.)

Systems with battery storage may require additional testing to confirm that the battery system, with the

utility side de-energized, provides power to the designated customer circuits only, and does not back feed

into the main panel (into the Department's grid).

2. Be certified by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory to fully comply with UL1741SA performance
and grid safety standards. The Certificate of Compliance should state that this utility interactive inverter met
all applicable requirements of current editions of UL1741SA and IEEE1547-2018/2020a, including testing
conformance to IEEE1547.1-2020. Also, refer to sections R and S (pages 8-9i & 8-10i) for specification,
testing and evaluation requirements. All inverters shall be included in the California Energy Commission’s
(CEC) list.

3. Be accepted by the Department of Building and Safety, City of Los Angeles, or other Authority Having
Jurisdiction (AHJ).

4. Have safeguards to prevent power flow into un-energized Department's electric system.

5. Have the voltage output match the electrical characteristics of the service provided by the Department. For
example, a single-phase inverter shall not be connected to a three-phase service, and an inverter of one
voltage class shall not be connected to a service of a different voltage class. See page 1-25 for available
service classes.

Exception 1: Customer provides, at their expense, transformation between the performance meter and
NET energy or generation meter to match the electrical characteristics of the service
provided by the Department.

Exception 2: When connected to a three-phase service, three single-phase inverters may be used in lieu
of a three-phase inverter, provided that the customer maintains IEEE1547-2018/2020a
compliance by installing additional certified equipment to shut down all inverters in the
event of a “loss or open of phase” event and maintain a balanced condition when
connected to a three-phase system.

6. Have an output that may be measured by a performance meter (see section H) conforming to one of the
Department’s standard meter configurations. See page 2-5 for standard meter configurations.

7. Operate as a current source rather than a voltage source; so that open-circuited inverter shall have an
output of zero volts. It shall only produce power output when it is connected to an energized Electric Power
System (EPS). The inverter’s voltage output will not be independent from the Department’s service supply
voltage, but it will be synchronized with it in such a way as to produce a current and power flow from the
Customer's parallel-generation into the Department’s power system (grid).

8. Operate within the Department’s acceptable service supply voltage ranges. See Acceptable Voltage
Ranges, page 1-26 for additional information.

9. For the purposes of these requirements, be defined by its maximum continuous output power at unity
power factor.

10. Include a Utility Settings Compliance report indicating conformance with the Department’s UL1741SA
Smart Inverter Technical Requirements. This report shall be submitted to the Department upon request.

V. Battery Backup Systems

Battery backup systems are used to provide emergency standby power to essential loads during a disturbance
on the Department’s electric system (grid), see pages 8-20i (figure 6) and 8-22i (figure 8). A battery backup
system shall:

1.

Be used to serve essential loads on the customer's premises, only.

Have safeguards to prevent a parallel connection with the Department's electric system such as an
external automatic transfer switch (ATS), manual transfer switch, or double throw safety switch that is listed
by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory for this application (example: UL1008 standard for transfer
switches). See EMERGENCY OR STAND-BY GENERATORS, page 1-32 for additional information.

NOTES:

1.

10.

The customer shall furnish, install, and maintain all generation disconnect switches as required by the
Department.

a. An AC disconnect switch shall be located on the customer’s energy source side of the generation
performance meter. Consult with the Department for mounting heights and clearances.

b. A single fusible disconnect may be used in place of a separate circuit fuse and AC disconnect. The fusible
disconnect shall meet the same visual air gap and locking requirements as the AC disconnect and shall not
be used to isolate the customer's load panel. See UTILITY DISCONNECTING MEANS, page 8-6i for
additional information.

The customer’s generating system circuit shall be connected on the load side of the customer’s main service
disconnecting means as shown in figures 1 to 5, and 7 to 24.

Exception: Parallel generating systems may be connected on the line side of the customer's disconnecting
means as permitted by City, State or National Electric Codes. See GENERATORS AND
GENERATING SYSTEMS, page 8-10i for additional information.

The customer shall provide a meter socket for the installation of a Department performance meter. A
residential meter panel or a commercial safety-socket meter panel is required when the maximum output of the
generating system does not exceed 200 amperes. When the system output exceeds 200 amperes, a current-
transformer box or instrument-rated switchboard is required.

Note: The performance meter is intended to measure the total output of the customer’s generating system.
With the exception of monitoring equipment, no customer load is permitted on the generating system
side of the performance meter. Under certain circumstances, and if required to measure total
generation output, the Department may install additional performance meters at the customer’s
expense. See METERING, page 8-4i for additional information.

Optional customer installed performance monitoring equipment may be installed with restrictions, see
METERING page 8-4i. Customers who wish to monitor their generations performance should consider
consulting with their contractor for options when a Department supplied performance meter is not available.

The type of utility grid protection scheme required is dependent upon the size, type, and configuration of the
customer’s generation system, see PROTECTIVE SCHEMES page 8-7i.

Customer provided real time production monitoring equipment may be required as specified by the Department,
see PROTECTIVE SCHEMES page 8-7i.

Currently, customer loads shall not be supplied from a feed in tariff (FIT) system. The customer must apply for
a separate revenue meter and service from the Department.

An automatic transfer switch (ATS), manual transfer switch, or double throw safety switch shall be installed
between the customer’s backup system and the Department’s revenue meter, see BATTERY BACKUP
SYSTEMS page 8-12i and EMERGENCY OR STAND-BY GENERATORS page 1-32.

All systems that are designed to manage a customer’s peak energy demand shall be grid interactive, see
INVERTERS page 8-11i. Shall not be used with Department Generation or NET energy metering, and shall not
allow for the export of energy to the Department’s grid. All related devices shall be connected on the load side
of the customer’s main circuit breaker, see BATTERY PEAK SHAVING SYSTEMS page 8-13i.

Batteries shall not be located in the meter room. See pages 5-9 and 5-10 for more information. Contact the
Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (LADBS) or other Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) for
specific code requirements.

NOTES (Cont.):
11. Used for battery dispatch. No requirement at this time, standards are under development.

12. A normally open, maintenance bypass mechanical interlock shall be installed on an emergency panel provided
it is affixed to the panel in a permanent, tamper-resistant fashion and is listed by a Nationally Recognized
Testing Laboratory (NRTL) as an interlock device.

Note: A double throw safety switch or ATS may also be used.

13. Battery energy storage system equipment that includes external isolation relays as part of an integral system
shall be certified by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) to comply with the UL 9540 standard.
