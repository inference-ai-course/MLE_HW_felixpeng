NET ENERGY METERING (NEM) GUIDELINES

Net Energy Metering (NEM) measures the difference between the electricity supplied
from the electric grid and the electricity generated on the Customer’s premises and
delivered back to the electric grid or net energy recorded at the service point. All grid-
tied solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems in the LADWP service territory, whether
participating in NEM or not, are required to comply with LADWP interconnection

requirements.

NEM participation is governed by the NEM Service Rider. If electricity supplied by
LADWP is more than or equal to the electricity generated by the customer over the
billing period, the customer shall be billed for the net energy supplied under the
customer’s current applicable rate. As applicable, customers may choose to participate
in the standard rate or time-of-use rate.

If electricity supplied by LADWP is less than the electricity generated by the customer's
Solar PV System over the billing period, a credit for the excess energy will be applied to
a customer’s balance. Credit balances will only be applied to the bill associated with the
meter that measured the excess energy. LADWP will apply any credit balance to
charges under each subsequent bill except taxes and minimum charges until no further
adjustment is due to the customer. If a credit balance remains at the time when the
customer terminates service, the balance will automatically be adjusted to zero and the
customer shall be owed no further compensation for excess generation. Information on

LADWP’s rate ordinances and service riders is available at

www.ladwp.com/electricrates.

1.0 NEM Eligibility and Limitations
Solar PV Systems must meet the following requirements to be considered for

eligibility:

e System Size — Net Energy Metering (NEM) is limited to Solar PV Systems
less than or equal to 1 MW- ACSES. Systems outside of this range are NOT

eligible for NEM and will be placed on the appropriate Parallel Generation

electric rate, either Schedule CG-2 or CG-3.

Customer owns and operates a permanent Solar PV System that is located on
the Customer’s premises and is operating in parallel to LADWP’s electric system
to offset part or all of the Customer’s own electricity requirements. The final
determination of the applicability of the NEM Service Rider resides solely with
LADWP.

Any energy generated by the Solar PV System must be either utilized on Site by
the Customer or delivered to LADWP in exchange for a credit on the Customer’s
bill in accordance with the NEM Service Rider. Energy cannot be sold to any
other entities.

Customers with the following service rates are eligible for the NEM Service Rider:
Schedule R-1; Schedule A-1; Schedule A-2; and Schedule A-3.

Customers on any rate other than the R-1A Residential rate are urged to request
a rate analysis to make sure they understand that installation of the Solar PV
System may result in a rate change. This change may have financial impacts that
require consideration prior to installation. Customers may request a rate analysis
from their Account Manager or by contacting the rates hotline at
rates@ladwp.com or 213-367-4718.

NEM Equipment Leasing

Leasing a Solar PV System can be comparable to system ownership in some cases,

allowing the Customer to participate in NEM. If the Customer owns the premises or is a

long-term Tenant Customer, they may lease the system from a third-party provided that

lease follows these Guidelines.

The equipment lease shall provide for the following:

. Aminimum lease term of at least 10 years.

2. The equipment lease provides lessee with an ownership option by the end of the

lease term.

4 Modified 4/28/21


=== PAGE 5 ===
3. The equipment lease payments may not be based on energy production from the
equipment, which could be interpreted as the sale of electricity. The lease may
include escalator or reduction clauses unrelated to energy production. The sale
of energy by anyone other than LADWP is prohibited.

To participate in the NEM with a leased Solar PV System, the lessor and the lessee
must complete and submit the Solar Lease Compliance Form (SLCF) along with the
equipment lease. The SLCF will serve as an attestation that the lessor and the lessee
will comply with these Guidelines. If the equipment lease is modified or amended, the
parties shall submit a copy of the lease to the LADWP Solar Program Manager along

with a newly executed SLCF.

LADWP reserves the right to audit and review executed equipment leases held between
lessor and lessee who have applied to NEM. The determination of acceptability of the
equipment lease agreement is at the sole discretion of LADWP. Any review will
determine if the lease complies with the NEM Guidelines. If the executed lease is not in
compliance with the NEM Guidelines as attested in the SLCF, LADWP may take the

following actions:

1. Not allow interconnection to LADWP’s grid by locking out the Solar PV System’s
AC disconnect switch.

2. Remove Customer from the NEM Service Rider.

3. Charge $300.00 for disconnect/reconnect fee as applicable.

1.2. NEM Eligibility for Tenant Customers

Tenant Customers may be eligible for NEM provided that they have an electrically
distinct Solar PV System connected to their electric meter. The Tenant Customer shall
sign the applicable Interconnection Agreement. If the owner of the real property at the
leased or rented service address also has responsibility to design, construct, own,
operate, or maintain the Solar PV System or any other connected equipment, both the
Tenant Customer and the owner of the associated real property shall sign the applicable

Interconnection Agreement. In cases where all costs associated with the LADWP’s

5 Modified 4/28/2021


=== PAGE 6 ===
interconnection of the Solar PV System have not previously been paid, the Tenant
Customer shall be responsible for the interconnection cost.

Tenant Customer must provide LADWP with a copy of the rental agreement (or property
lease.) To be eligible for NEM, the rental agreement/property lease must provide Tenant
Customer with all rights to receive energy from the Solar PV System; and rent payments
may not be based on energy production from the solar PV equipment, which could be
interpreted as the sale of electricity. Rent payments may not be, in any way, tied to the
per kilowatt-hour rate LADWP charges its ratepayers, or established in any other
manner that could be interpreted as sale of energy. The sale of energy by anyone other
than LADWP is prohibited.

To participate in NEM, Tenant Customers and associated property owners must
complete and submit the Tenant Customer Compliance Form (TENCF) along with the
rental agreement (or amended rental agreement if the original rental agreement is
amended). The TENCF will serve as an attestation that the Tenant Customer and

property owner will comply with these Guidelines.

1.3. NEM Interconnection Process

LADWP has discontinued the Solar Incentive Program. In order to participate in NEM,
customers must complete an application on the Solar Automated Meter Spot website at
www.ladwp.com/nem to obtain an Interconnection Work Request Number (WRé#). Solar
Projects less than 10 kW-ACCE® that do not involve a service upgrade or battery backup
may be eligible to receive the fast tracked solar process as set forth on the Solar

Automated Meter Spot website.

1.3.1. Request for Inspection

Once the Solar PV System is constructed and the permit has been finalized, City of Los
Angeles Department of Building and Safety (LADBS) will release the Project to LADWP
for solar inspection and meter installation. The solar inspection and meter installation is
coordinated by the Connection Center. Customers may contact the Connection Center

6 Modified 4/28/21


=== PAGE 7 ===
at (213) 367-6937 with questions on the interconnection process or to inquire about the

status of their Project interconnection.

1.3.2. Solar PV System Inspections

The separate inspections that are required before the PV generating system can
be Placed in Service are:
1. LADBS Permit Inspection
2. LADWP Electric Service Representative (ESR) Inspection (for systems greater
than or equal to 10 kW-AC°E° and some special cases less than 10 kW-ACCEC)
3. LADWP Solar Inspection

Solar PV Systems may not be operated and may be locked until all inspections
are completed, the Customer signs an interconnection agreement (when
applicable), and a net meter has been installed. A locked system shall only be
unlocked by the LADWP net meter installer, at which time the system can be Placed in
Service and operated.

Systems that are not in compliance with the LADWP Electric Service Requirements,
local ordinances, or applicable electrical codes and standards will fail the LADWP solar

inspection.

2.1.

Installation & Interconnection Requirements

All systems must be installed and operated in conformance with the system
manufacturer's specifications, applicable electrical codes and standards, LADWP
Electric Service Requirements and the Interconnection Agreement. LADWP’s
Electric Service Requirements Manual can be found online at
www.ladwp.com/codes. Systems may be self-installed by the customer or
installed by a licensed contractor/installer.

All systems must have any necessary permits from LADBS.

All Solar PV Systems must be equipped with a disconnect device as required by
the LADWP Electric Service Requirements. Performance Meters and devices
used to disconnect the Solar PV System shall be readily accessible and located

in accordance with LADWP’s Electric Service Requirements.

Every solar installation is subject to inspection by the LADWP Solar Inspector,
while more complex solar installations will require additional review and
inspection by the LADWP Distribution Engineer and/or ESR to ensure
compliance with the LADWP Electric Service Requirements.

Upon submission of a completed and signed Interconnection Agreement, an
LADWP Service Planning staff member will be assigned to work with the
customer to ensure proper interconnection to the LADWP grid. It is imperative
that applicants and their contractors work closely with their assigned Distribution
Engineer and ESR to ensure the efficient, safe, and successful installation of

their solar Projects.

All grid-interconnected Energy Storage Systems will require preliminary review
and inspection by an LADWP Distribution Engineer and ESR. Contact the

Connection Center at (213) 367-6937 for more information.

Interconnection Agreement

Customers with a solar PV generation facility and/or Energy Storage System, where

one or both has a capacity greater than 10 kW-ACCES, are required to complete an

8 Modified 4/28/21


=== PAGE 9 ===
Interconnection Agreement with LADWP before the generation facility and/or storage
may be interconnected to LADWP’s electric system. The LADWP customer of record
must sign the Interconnection Agreement. If the owner of the real property at the leased
or rented service address also has responsibility to design, construct, own, operate, or
maintain the solar PV generation facility and/or Energy Storage System, or any other
connected equipment, both the Tenant Customer and the owner of the associated real
property shall sign the applicable Interconnection Agreement. The names of business
customers and real property owners must match State of California Secretary of State

records for an active business.

Customers with a solar PV generation facility and/or Energy Storage System, where
one or both has a capacity greater than 10 kW-ACCE® but less than or equal to 30 kW-
ACCEC, must complete, sign, and submit a Customer-Owned Solar-Powered Electrical
Generation Facility and/or Energy Storage System Interconnection Agreement (Short-
Form IA). The Short-Form IA can be found at LADWP’s solar website.

Customers with Solar PV Systems greater than 30 kW-ACCF© must complete the Long-
Form Solar-Powered Customer Generation Interconnection Agreement (Long-Form IA).
The Long-Form IA can be obtained by calling the ESD Distribution Systems Engineering
Co-generation Coordinator at 213-367-2726. A single line electrical diagram must be
submitted with the Long-Form IA, in order for a LADWP Distribution Engineer to be
assigned to assist in this more detailed interconnection process. In addition, an
engineer must be assigned and the single line diagram approved before an Electrical
Service Representative can assist with meter and disconnect spotting.

2.2. Metering

NEM measures the flow of electricity in two directions. LADWP provides the necessary
net meter. In the event a customer installation provides atypical metering requirements,
however, the customer shall be responsible for LADWP’s expense of purchasing and
installing a meter that is able to measure electricity flow in two directions. If an additional
meter or meters are installed, the net meter configuration shall yield a result identical to

that of a single meter.

9 Modified 4/28/2021


=== PAGE 10 ===
The solar equipment must be connected to the customer’s billing meter, which will be
the only meter that is converted to a net meter. Net meters are digital and capable of
wireless communication with LADWP to accommodate billing. Installations less than or
equal to 30 kW-ACCF® are also required to install an electromechanical meter having
either an analog or liquid crystal display if they do not have performance metering built
into their inverter. The meter must be rated for outdoor use.

For certain Solar PV Systems, the installation of digital Performance meters will be
required per LADWP’s Electric Service Requirements Manual. Therefore, certain Solar
PV Systems will have two digital meters capable of wireless communication with
LADWP. The socket for the Performance Meter must be a separate 4-pin meter socket
that must be installed outdoors in close proximity to the LADWP billing meter and the
required AC disconnect device. The meter socket shall be located so that the centerline
of the meter is at a height of between 4 feet and 6 feet 3 inches.

Customers may not opt-out of the use of digital meters with wireless communication

capabilities.

Meters are the property of LADWP and may NOT be moved to another site. They are
registered to a specific parcel of property. Refer to the Electric Service Requirements

Manual for additional metering requirements.
